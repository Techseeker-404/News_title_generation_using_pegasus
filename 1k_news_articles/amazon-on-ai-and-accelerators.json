At a corporate event in San Francisco, Wood talked with EE Times about the status and outlook of deep learning, what Amazon wants in semiconductors for it and his not-so-strange career path from genomics to cloud computing. After earning a PhD in bioinformatics in 2004, Wood went to work for a U.K. institute that handled a third of the initial work decoding the human genome. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was just a sample to get a blueprint. We did 40 other species including zebra fish and the duck-billed platypus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an odd creature with 10 sex chromosomes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wood quipped. Technology caught up with what was a billion-dollar effort that took a decade. A nearby U.K. startup developed a $100,000 system that could sequence a genome in a week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were just around the corner, so they sent their first instrument over in the back of a taxi. Within six months we had 200 more, working on thousands of genomes and cell lines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalled. The advance was opening the door to leaps such as personalized treatments for cancer. There was just one problem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was data-intensive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we generated several hundred terabytes a week. We had a data center, but we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any more power on the site without spending tens of millions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith no more storage on the premises, I called a friend who had just joined Amazon. It was around the time AWS was just getting started. They gave me a $300 credit in return for writing a white paper on how to start a cloud-based genomics platform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finished the white paper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he quipped. What he did get was \u00e2\u0080\u009creligion around cloud computing\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a phone call from AWS offering him a job.

(Images EE Times)   He helped set technical strategy for the team, and since 2008 has had a hand in launching a laundry list of AWS products including Lambda, which AWS pitches as the future of software development. He was also present at the birth of Alexa, Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virtual voice assistant, embedded in its Echo smart speaker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEcho came from a brainstorm about what things we could build if we had infinite compute. The original idea was like the Star Trek computer you talk to\u2013that was the seed for what become Echo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Wood was tapped to head AWS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI efforts in part because of his genomics background. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s machine learning uses the same foundational concepts we were using for folding proteins. The big change was in deep convolutions in the networks to build a hierarchical view for interpreting data such as images. Adding deep layers lets you fine tune a model to select images of cats from dogs, for example,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. "}
