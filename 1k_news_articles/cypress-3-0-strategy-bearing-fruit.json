{"Author": "Dylan McGrath\u00a0", "Date": "04.27.2017", "Keywords": "", "Article": " SAN FRANCISCO\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cypress Semiconductor Corp. reported record first quarter sales that beat analysts\u2019 expectations Thursday (April 27), offering tangible evidence that the company\u2019s strategy to target markets growing faster than the overall semiconductor industry is bearing fruit. \u201cOur revenue strength in the first quarter was across end markets, particularly from IoT, and NOR memory was stronger than we expected,\u201d said Hassane El-Khoury, Cypress president and CEO, in a conference call with analysts following the quarterly report. El-Khoury said automotive was Cypress\u2019s strongest end market in the first quarter, with record sales and design activity. He said automotive sales now make up about one-third of Cypress\u2019s total revenue, up from just 11 percent of the firm\u2019s revenue in 2011. El-Khoury, who took the helm of Cypress last August following the April resignation of Cypress Founder and longtime CEO T.J. Rodgers, calls his strategy for realigning the company around core growing markets \u201cCypress 3.0.\u201d The strategy revolves around both organic and inorganic growth, through both internal product development and deals such as the acquisitions of Spansion in 2015 and Broadcom\u2019s wireless IoT business last year. Thad Trent, Cypress\u2019s chief financial officer, said on the analyst call Thursday that the strategy is resulting in revenue growth, gross margin improvement and operating leverage across the company.  \u201cOur Q1 results reflect the actions we have taken to reorganize the company to align our solutions, our investments and our corporate structure with our go-to-market plan and our focus on high-growth areas of the automotive, industrial and consumer markets, including the Internet of Things and USB connectivity,\u201d El-Khoury said. Cypress reported first quarter sales of $531.9 million, the highest quarterly revenue that Cypress has reported since spinning off SunPower Corp. several years ago. First quarter sales were up slightly compared with the first quarter of 2016. Cypress reported a loss for the quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $45.8 million, narrowed from a GAAP net loss of $72.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. Cypress\u2019s sales for the quarter exceeded both the company\u2019s own estimates and those of Wall Street\u2019s. The company\u2019s pro forma earnings per share of 13 cents also exceeded consensus analysts\u2019 expectations by a wide margin. For the second quarter, Cypress said it expects sales to be between $530 million and $560 million, the midpoint of which is well above consensus analysts\u2019 estimates. El-Khoury said Cypress expects continued strength in the second quarter in products \u201cacross the board.\u201d He noted that the company\u2019s status as a supplier to the automotive industry gives it great visibility into sales in coming months. \u00e2\u0080\u0094Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
