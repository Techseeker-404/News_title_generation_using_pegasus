In a webcast for investors and analysts, president and CEO Hassane El-Khoury said that it was the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best quarter since 2011, and its \u00e2\u0080\u009cCypress 3.0\u00e2\u0080\u009d strategy begun in 2016 to focus on the IoT is paying off faster than expected. Cypress reported record revenue of $604.6 million with its IoT wireless connectivity business growing 80% year over year. Cash from operations of $143.8 million increased 37% year over year. El-Khoury highlighted the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combination Bluetooth/Wi-Fi chips as a key reason that Cypress has the \u00e2\u0080\u009c#1 connectivity business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but its MCU and memory portfolios are also key contributors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMCU and memory products are critical to our IoT strategy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of our IoT customers use memory products for mission-critical applications, thus putting a premium on Cypress memory products.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Consumers are helping to drive Cypress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growth, in part due to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s USB-C business that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefitting from Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest iPhones, as well as its technologies being incorporated into products popular with the upcoming holiday shopping crowd, said El-Khoury, such as smart home products and even connected cars. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsumers buy IoT products expecting a great experience. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Cypress wins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Sponsored: Solving the problem of flash memory density]  Beyond specific market segments, Cypress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has shifted away from low-margin, commoditized businesses to higher-margin, \u00e2\u0080\u009csticky businesses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as cross-selling to provide customers solutions at the system level. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers are relying on it for more bill-of-material coverage, with approximately 80% of its revenue generated by customers buying more than one product family across connectivity, microcontrollers, and memory. This cross-selling approach includes smart cars for driver safety such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and infotainment systems that help OEMs differentiate themselves, said El-Khoury. The company only has so much capacity, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to stay in its sweet spot and continue to focus on the automotive and industrial segments. In a one-on-one telephone interview with EE Times following the webcast, El-Khoury said that value-added memory products really speak to the needs of the industrial and automotive markets, and Cypress expects to see a lot of traction over the next five to 10 years. He noted that some of the ADAS designs using the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even begun to ramp up yet.   Cypress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 broad automotive product portfolio that includes AEC-Q100-qualified microcontrollers, flash memories, PMICs, and Human Machine Interface devices helped to drive record revenue in its latest quarter. Automotive is a segment in which safety and security are critical, and that extends to other embedded applications such as the smart home and wearables. El-Khoury said that the company hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t abandoned any customers by dropping lower-margin opportunities. Rather, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changed its approach to going to market with these customers. He said that customers are putting a lot of investment upfront, particularly into complex software capabilities, and want assurance that vendors are equally committed to a roadmap across different streams. In Cypress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 case, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the connectivity through Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, the MCU, and the memory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want confidence that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in all three.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rather than playing vendors off of each other for the best deal, said El-Khoury, customers want to partner with a one-stop shop so that they can move quickly. Otherwise, they risk losing market share. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce they pick a vendor, the investment happens on both sides. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a partnership than a customer agreement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that this is particularly true in automotive, wherein getting approved as a supplier is a rigorous process for an OEM. Like other vendors, favorable pricing in the NAND flash segment helped boost revenue for Cypress, said Jim Handy, principal analyst with Objective Analysis, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also built a broader portfolio and is spending more time focusing on its own profitability and targets rather than outdoing a competitor. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also done a good job of nurturing the automotive business that it acquired through Spansion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCypress was not big in the automotive market until they bought Spansion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy of having more than one product in a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environment is something that all large semiconductors are aiming for so that customers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to competitors. It gives customers \u00e2\u0080\u009cone throat to choke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d although they are wary of getting locked in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCautious OEMs will always make sure that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become overly reliant on one supplier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Handy said that Cypress is \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell-defended\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the SLC NAND flash market, one that most companies don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to deal with. SLC NAND sells for 10 times more, but only costs twice as much to manufacture. He sees a lot of upside for the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi product portfolio as there are still new things being connected wirelessly, such as doorbell security cameras. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could picture a lot more things like that going into the home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.
