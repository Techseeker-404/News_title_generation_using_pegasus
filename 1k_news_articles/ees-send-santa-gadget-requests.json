Among the responses, Arduino co-founder Massimo Banzi showed his passion for open source and Maker goodies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would definitely love to get an Original Prusa SL1 3D printer :),\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. Luddite that I am, I had to google the gadget. Duh! Promoters claim that the Prusa i3 was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most used 3D printer in the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 2016. The SL1 is apparently the latest of many incarnations of the open-source printer that has spawned a swarm of people making versions of them. The new model, announced by Josef Pr\u00c5\u00af\u00c5\u00a1a himself in late September, looks like a large food processor and makes objects measuring up to 120 \u00c3\u0097 68 \u00c3\u0097 150 mm. Mr. Banzi, I will gladly forward your request to Santa, but I have to note that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tad pricey at $1,299 as a DIY kit or $1,599 pre-assembled. Given your background, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll assume that you would be OK with the kit. Sorting through my emails, I see that Michael Frank has an even bigger wish. The LG Electronics engineering manager is asking Santa for \u00e2\u0080\u009ca 3D printer that could print silicon chips for prototyping a 16FF design at home. No more $10M mask set to check out ideas and three months or longer for fab time. FPGAs are a nice start, but they are still too expensive, too slow, and awkward to use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give him credit for being imaginative. Santa will, no doubt, have to set a team of engineers on this request. Santa is thankful that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask for the 7-nm model because the North Pole is waaaay behind on EUV.   With the SL1, you can even make yourself a new set of dentures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least for next Halloween. Click to enlarge. (Source: Prusa Research)   Kevin Deierling from Mellanox was much more practical, asking for a PlayPiper. Yes, I had to look it up, too. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a young person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first kit for building a computer using a Minecraft video tutorial. The company got engineering legend Steve Wozniak to give it an endorsement. But Deierling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendation was more detailed and right on target: \u00e2\u0080\u009cUsually, engineers can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really explain to their kids what they do. The Piper Computer Kit is a great way to bridge this gap and teach your kids about technology. As engineers, sometimes we forget the wonder and joy of just building the things that technology enables. Kids can remind us of this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and remind us why we first decided to do all the hard work that it takes to become engineers. And it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt that the kids will learn some cool stuff and have some fun, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Last, but not least, I have to add Cyril Ebersweiler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request to this list. The founder of Hax, one of the first hardware-startup accelerators, has come across a lot of gadgets in the course of working with nearly 300 startups. So I thought that his request would be for some rare gadget that few had ever heard of. Not so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cActually, for me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably time to get an Apple Watch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Done! There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still time to add your request for a gadget to the list that I will email to Santa just before midnight on Dec. 24. Please let me know what you would like and why in the comment thread below this article. Happy holidays! \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times    "}
