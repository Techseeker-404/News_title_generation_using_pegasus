In an Aug. 29 blog post, CQ Amateur Radio reported on the petition drive.     The drive consists of two petitions, each needing 100,000 signatures. One has a deadline of Sept. 15, while the other deadline is Sept. 17. Unfortunately, the petitions both call for continued funding of WWV and WWHV. That's unfortunate because unless everyone who signs one also signs the other, they may both fail.     WWV radio station in Fort Collins, Colorado, is slated to shut down in its 100th  year because of budget cuts. Source: NIST.       According to CQ Amateur Radio, \u201cTens of thousands of radio amateurs and other users of the shortwave spectrum rely on these stations as sources of accurate time and precise frequency measurement as well as a wealth of propagation data.\u201d The post also notes that Station WWVB would continue to be funded.    \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
