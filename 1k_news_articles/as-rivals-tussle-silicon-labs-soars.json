The Austin, Texas-based chip vendor has taken a methodical approach in its pursuit of the IoT market, focused keenly on expanding its wireless portfolio and developing a multiprotocol environment among different wireless networks.\u00c2\u00a0 These efforts, most recently, resulted in a record $100 million in revenue from the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IoT products in the third quarter of 2017.\u00c2\u00a0 Silicon Labs CEO Tyson Tuttle, buttonholed at the Consumer Electronics Show, conceded that his company has benefited from turmoil among its rivals, who have been preoccupied with M&A upheavals. Silicon Labs' CEO Tyson Tuttle at CES (Photo: Silicon Labs)  Tuttle explained that during the prolonged M&A fever, companies facing uncertainty about the future tend to start either canceling programs or losing talent. Instability breeds confusion and anxiety among both customers and employees. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople tend to think, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait for what will happen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tuttle.\u00c2\u00a0 Silicon Labs, on the other hand, has been able to snag a few stars who were formerly with Freescale or NXP Semiconductors. NXP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquisition by Qualcomm, originally scheduled to close at the end of 2017, is still pending. Meanwhile, Qualcomm might be acquired in a hostile takeover bid Broadcom launched late last year. Silicon Labs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge, for now, is that \u00e2\u0080\u009cour customers know that we are in the IoT business for the long haul,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the CEO said. Silicon Labs is expecting its IoT business to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25 percent, Tuttle told us. Noting that a half of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IoT revenue is generated from wireless products, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur wireless business is growing at a 40 percent (CAGR).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Focus on wireless  Last month, Silicon Labs announced a plan to acquire Sigma Designs for $282 million in cash. The deal is designed to broaden Silicon Labs' IoT connectivity product portfolio to include Z-Wave, a wireless mesh technology using low-energy radio waves for IoT smart home devices.\u00c2\u00a0 The acquisition has not closed yet, so Tuttle declined to detail plans for Z-Wave.\u00c2\u00a0However, the addition of Z-Wave would mark a crowning moment for Silicon Labs. It has spent several years steadily expanding its wireless portfolio\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 which now includes Bluetooth, Thread and Zigbee\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and patiently developing multiprotocol solutions. According to the Z-Wave Alliance, more than 2,100 interoperable Z-Wave uses have been developed, and more than 70 million Z-Wave products sold since 2001. What about WAN?  So, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next for Silicon Labs? Any plans to get into NB-IoT or any other low-power Wide Area Network technologies? Tuttle said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWide Area Network (WAN) is something we are monitoring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the company has no immediate plans in that market. \u00c2\u00a0 Silicon Labs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 focus has always been on Personal Area Network (PAN) and Local Area Network (LAN), but not WAN. Tuttle remains skeptical of WAN, when [cellular] operators get involved in building IoT networks. The issue for IoT device vendors is, he asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow are you going to make money\u00e2\u0080\u009d if you have to shell out fees to cellular networks? Silicon Labs, thus far, has never had to build any relationships with [cellular] operators. For his company, Tuttle sees in WAN \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarket risks, time-to-market problems and uncertainty of overall development.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He noted that Silicon Labs is no Qualcomm, MediaTek, Huawei or Intel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe find WAN a difficult landscape for us. Besides, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to jump in the market where we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become a leader.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tuttle did mention last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of a collaboration with Hager Group (Obernai, France). Hager is rolling out a new smart RF module incorporating Silicon Labs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wireless Gecko SoC, combining 2.4GHz Bluetooth, sub-GHz KNX and Sigfox LWAN connectivity. The module is designed to enable \u00e2\u0080\u009cenergy-efficient multiprotocol and multiband connectivity at 2.4 GHz, 868 MHz and 433 MHz,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the two companies. "}
