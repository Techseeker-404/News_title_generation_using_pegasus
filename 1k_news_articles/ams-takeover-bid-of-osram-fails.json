AMS said it has received the support of 51.6 percent of Osram shareholders, below the unconditional acceptance level of 62.5 percent. AMS, however, remains the largest shareholder with 19.9 percent share of Osram. A week ago, AMS announced it had raised its previous all-cash offer to $45 (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac41) per share, or $4.9 billion (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac4.5 billion). Presented as its \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest and final\u00e2\u0080\u009d offer, this move could have ended a months-long bidding battle with private equity rivals. AMS\u2019 latest offer indeed occurred two days after a consortium comprising of Advent and Bain Capital clearly expressed their intention to offer a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeaningful premium over the current offer from AMS\u00e2\u0080\u009d of $42.2 (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac38.5) per share, or $4.7 billion (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac4.3 billion). Private equity firms Bain Capital and The Carlyle Group had previously submitted an offer for $38.4 (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac35) per share, which Osram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest shareholder Allianz Global Investors rejected as too low. Asked to comment on AMS takeover offer, Dimitrios Damianos, technology market analyst with Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppment (Lyon, France), said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey made a big bid in order to acquire Osram because it is critical for them to leverage their time-of-flight sensors by using Osram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing portfolio and clients. Their time-of-flight is now used for face recognition in smartphones, and they want to differentiate by entering the lighting market that Osram can offer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Best and final? Was it really AMS\u2019 best and final offer? Maybe not, as it stated on Friday it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinues to view the combination of AMS and Osram as strategically compelling\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cto explore strategic options to pursue the acquisition of Osram.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Complementarity \u201cOur goal is to create a global leader in sensor solutions and photonics, based on European technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amy Fl\u00c3\u00a9cher, vice president marketing communications, AMS, told EE Times . Stressing the complementary nature of the two businesses, she added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOsram is the leader in visible and invisible light emitters, and aspires to develop IC design, optics & optical packaging capabilities\u00e2\u0080\u009d, while \u00e2\u0080\u009cAMS is in IC design, optics & optical packaging capabilities and aspires to add a leadership position in emitters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An underlying reason for the takeover bid is that AMS is heavily reliant on a single customer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Apple. Acquiring Osram would expand its business and diversify its revenue mix. In the first half of 2019, AMS\u2019 consumer business accounted for 75 percent of its total revenue, while the automotive and industrial & medical businesses accounted for 10 and 15 percent, respectively. The long-term goal is to generate 35-40 percent revenue both in the automotive and consumer businesses and 20-30 percent in the industrial & medical business.   Source: AMS  The expected revenue growth, Fl\u00c3\u00a9cher said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis driven by content opportunities not volume growth, and we see it in our consumer business and in automotive going forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  If the acquisition goes through, \u00e2\u0080\u009cboth companies would need to step up R&D investments to build the complementary required capabilities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, shifting from conditional tense to active tense, Fl\u00c3\u00a9cher said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe combination of the businesses will drive R&D efficiency, and the targeted solutions will be brought faster and more efficiently to market as existing strengths can be leveraged immediately to win in breakthrough optical solution areas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Commitments Because the initial bid raised concerns among unions and workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 representatives, AMS outlined commitments in its latest offer to safeguard Osram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 27,400 employees and production facilities in Germany. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a corporation agreement with some paragraphs with protective clauses regarding German sites and employees,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Torsten Wolf, Head of Core Communications, Osram. Pledging AMS good intentions, Fl\u00c3\u00a9cher said its latest bid offered \u00e2\u0080\u009cextensive commitments in line or better than other proposals on the table for this and has an integration plan. Our plans sees a build of jobs in Germany, particularly in Regensburg.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To finance the bid, AMS said it had secured $4.84 billion (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac4.4 billion) in loans from UBS, HSBC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. In addition, AMS said it intended to raise $1.76 billion (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.6 billion).     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
