On the eve of CES, GoPro announced plans to exit the drone business, cut 250 jobs and lower its fourth quarter revenue estimate. Fermi Wang, told EE Times that Ambarella has already experienced a decline in GoPro-based revenue. Last year, it was \u201c10-plus percent,\u201d Wang said. He expects the company's GoPro revenue to sink to a \u201cvery low number\u201d this year. Making up for the lost revenue are the surveillance (professional and consumer) and auto OEM markets, he noted. Today, the company derives roughly 15 percent of the its revenue from the automotive sector. Inside the CV1 SoC.Source: Ambarella    What Ambarella sees as its ace in the hole, though, is a new CVflow architecture that delivers stereovision processing and deep learning perception algorithms. Ambarella\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal for CV1 and a series of new computer vision chips based on CVflow (to follow later) is to get a head start in the self-driving vehicle market while capturing other automotive applications, including ADAS, electronic mirror, and surround view.
