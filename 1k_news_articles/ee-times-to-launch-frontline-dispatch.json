{"Author": "Junko Yoshida\u00a0", "Date": "09.14.2018", "Keywords": "", "Article": "  As EE Times transitions to a newly redesigned home page, we plan to launch a new approach to our editorial coverage. Reporters and editors learn from corporations on their financial results, business development, new technologies and new products in the form of press releases.We regularly talk to executives, spokespeople and engineers at different companies, exercising our due diligence in news and analysis. While this is just fine and dandy with us, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m alone wondering what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening to products and technologies out in the real world, after our initial coverage. Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we all like to know? Our challenge, which we embrace, is to add a third dimension to our industry coverage. We call it\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrontline Dispatch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the Frontline Dispatch, we will follow up with the design engineering and supply chain communities who stand on the frontline. Our objective is to see and experience\u00c2\u00a0from these insider perspectives what happens before, during andafter new technologies and products emerge. Our job is to prod corporations to talk and write about\u00c2\u00a0specific\u00c2\u00a0design and engineering issues,challenges, new opportunities and experiencesthey \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or their customers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have encountered during product development, manufacturing and management phases.   Teachable moments\u00c2\u00a0  Stories about false trails, oopses, setbacks, unexpected discoveries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether in hands-on design, product development, supply and supplier management or business decisions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are bread and butter to our readers. Our Frontline Dispatch is where chip developers, field applications engineers, systems designers, distributors, marketers and executives will share \u00e2\u0080\u009cwar stories\u00e2\u0080\u009d about \u00e2\u0080\u009caha\u00e2\u0080\u009d moments, and how they eventually solved problems \u00e2\u0080\u0094or are in the process of doing so. Their tribulations and triumphs are \u00e2\u0080\u009cteachable moments\u00e2\u0080\u009d to share with other design engineers. Here it is: your moment to tell your own stories. Our job is to hunt down good stories. We see the Frontline Dispatch initiative as a vehicle for you and us to tell better, deeper and effective stories. Open to everyone  The Frontline Dispatch is open to all chip, component and system companies and distributors. We welcome first-person narratives in the form of contributed pieces. But hey, not everyone writes! Our editors will be reaching out to design/engineering sources made available by companies. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll write stories based on interviews with them. The underlying imperative for us is to unearth stories to which our readers can relate. Our goal isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to simply write \u00e2\u0080\u009carticles, stories, or blogs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We want to hear about\u00c2\u00a0the personal experiences \u00c2\u00a0of design engineers, manufacturers, supply chain experts, software developers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everybody. Real stories, not press releases. Frontline Dispatch breakdown  Subsets of the Frontline Dispatch will be marked as From-the-Design Frontline, From-the-Manufacturing Floor, From-the-Procurement Desk, etc. As we cast a wider net, we hope The Frontline Dispatch can tell full stories that depict people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience at every step in the design chain. The Frontline Dispatch hopes to cover a variety of stories. Here are a few samples among them: Closing in on 4.0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 A lot of industry interest focuses on the IIoT and what Europe is calling Industrie 4.0. But what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on outside the hype? This question poses an opportunity to separate the promise from the execution.  LPWAN Wars \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 A few years ago there were many low-power wide-area networks under development. Where are they now? Which initiatives are quietly fading away, which gaining ascendancy, and which, really, have legs in the market?  Embedded security \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 As the industry realizes that connectivity equals vulnerability, how does the issue of security play out? Are costs rising? Is design practice changing? Is connectivity being restricted to avoid the issue? Are people still denying the need for security?  5G implementation\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 5G\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival is imminent. Dealing with mmWave, however, is a new challenge facing RF chip designers, 5G handset/base station developers and test equipment companies. What are the surprises, setbacks, lessons?  ADAS to Autonomous Vehicles\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The transition from ADAS to AV is going to take a long time. What specific technologies or chip solutions are automotive engineers looking for? What are not here yet (like multi-gigabit in-vehicle connectivity chips)?  FD-SOI \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 What specific advantages did FD-SOI-based chips bring to system designs?  Data center AI training \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 Is AI training taking too long? How big are the data sets necessary for AI training?  Ultra-low cost/low power IoT nodes\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I used chips that are touted as ultra-low cost, low power, designed for IoT nodes. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not seeing the results I expected. What am I doing wrong?  AI accelerators for edge computing \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 I tried AI accelerators and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not happy. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why.  New memory structure (i.e. HBM) \u2014\u00c2\u00a0 What should I expect from HBM? What do I need to know before plugging it into my systems?  Please note: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not asking corporations for all the answers or for their official analysis of the Big Picture. Instead, The Frontline Dispatch will be where real engineers discuss the issues they face in the field, as they face them. Contributors will share their experiences while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still experiencing them. The increments of problem-solving, in the words of the problem-solvers are the mission and the essence of our Frontline initiative.  Watch Us!
