Today, HD mapping is considered must-have data for highly automated driving. It can provide information just as critical as other sensory data generated by vision, lidar and radar.   Liran Bar, CEVA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director of production marketing, had his finger on it. Asked why mapping is such a big deal, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about prediction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d HD mapping enables you \u00e2\u0080\u009cto predict before lidars and radars detect that a road is blocked ahead, for example,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hugely important element in the advancement of the robo-car. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHD Mapping\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cConnectivity\u00e2\u0080\u009d (V2V, V2I) are both viewed as indispensable tools for \u00e2\u0080\u009cprediction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But much of their implementations needs a buy-in from everyone in the automotive industry, and a consensus to build common infrastructure. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed some progress. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone far enough. In this column, let me zoom in on the HD mapping issue. At the CES last week, Here, owned by a consortium of German automotive companies including Audi, BMW and Daimler, garnered numerous partnership deals.  Aside from Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement to buy a 15-percent stake in Here, Here and Nvidia also announced at CES an extended collaboration to develop Here HD Live Map into a real-time, high-definition mapping solution for autonomous vehicles.  Mobileye also disclosed that it is now working with Here to provide Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own crowd-sourced, high-definition mapping technology called Road Experience Management (REM).  Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for Vision Systems Intelligence (VSI), explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere brings value by providing the location platform and the infrastructure to support it. Mobileye brings a crowd source of data that collectively will pool with Here data to create a localization platform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  REM is a technology unique to Mobileye.  As Mobileye describes it, REM is \u00e2\u0080\u009cis an end-to-end mapping and localization engine for full autonomy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The solution consists of three layers: harvesting agents (any camera-equipped vehicle), map aggregating server (cloud), and map-consuming agents (autonomous vehicle).  The harvesting agents collect and transmit data about the driving path\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geometry and stationary landmarks. Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real-time geometrical and semantic analysis, implemented in the harvesting agent, allows it to compress map-relevant information \u00e2\u0080\u0093 facilitating very small communication bandwidth (less than 10KB/km on average).   Under this scheme, the relevant data is packed into small capsules called Road Segment Data (RSD) and sent to the cloud. The cloud server aggregates and reconciles the continuous stream of RSDs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a process resulting in a highly accurate and low time-to-reflect-reality map, which Mobileye calls \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoadbook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Amnon Shashua, Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s co-founder, CTO and chairman, sees Roadbook as a layer above what Here offers. He stressed, for Mobileye, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMapmakers are not competitors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Aside from Here, Mobileye announced a partnership with Japanese mapmaker Zenrin and an OEM to complete HD-Mapping of Japan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy October, 2018, we get this done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shashua promised. The ultimate goal for Mobileye is to develop \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorld Roadbook\u00e2\u0080\u009d in collaboration with a variety of OEMs. HD mapping isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only thing that needs to be shared among car OEMs, however.
