The company said the processor is appropriate for solid-state drives (SSDs), hard-disk drives (HDDs) and built-in storage solutions. Real-time embedded systems such as SSDs have historically required less then 4GB of DRAM and addressable space and have not needed to run Linux. With continually increasing storage capacities and performance requirements saturating throughput of storage host interfaces, the 4GB limit and inability to run Linux are adding complexity, and in some cases, becoming barriers. The Cortex-R82 processor, a 64-bit processor capable of addressing up to 1TB of address space is optimized for such systems, enabling higher performance, real-time compute with more addressable space and the ability to run Linux for the next generation of computational storage devices. According to Neil Werdmuller, director of storage solutions at Arm, the processor will help generate more insight at the location where data is stored. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor processing to take place closer to the data, we needed to deliver higher performance. The new Arm Cortex-R82 provides up to 2x performance uplift, depending on the workload, compared to previous Cortex-R generations. This will allow storage applications to run new workloads like machine learning at a lower latency, with optional Arm Neon technology to provide additional acceleration. Cortex-R82 is 64-bit, providing access of up to 1TB of DRAM for advanced data processing in storage applications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Cortex-R82 processor provides a performance uplift over Cortex-R8 on standard benchmarks and even higher uplift on actual partner code. Partner code execution is showing 74-125% performance uplift compared with Cortex-R8. (Image: Arm) Storage controllers traditionally run bare-metal/RTOS workloads to store and access data, however Cortex-R82 introduces an optional memory management unit (MMU) to allow for rich operating systems to run directly on the storage controller, creating the opportunity for new\u00c2\u00a0 applications. Werdmuller added that processing data where it is stored opens huge opportunities across applications including Internet of things (IoT), machine learning (ML) and edge computing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is critical in the storage use cases you might expect, such as database acceleration, meaning no movement of large files and increased security and privacy, and video transcoding where data can be efficiently transcoded or encoded for streaming, adapting different bit rates and resolutions as necessary. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also increasingly important for applications such as transportation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, modern airplanes generate terabytes of data a day that is usually offloaded for analysis. Computational storage offers airlines real-time analysis of this data on the drive, so when a plane lands, they can ensure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe for the next flight in 30 minutes or less, enabling faster turnaround and better safety for passengers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Arm Cortex-R82 compines MPU and optional MMU in a single core, allowing high-level operating systems like Linux to execute (Image: Arm) The new features of the Cortex-R82 processor supports multi-core implementations of up to eight cores. The types of workload running on the storage controller is adjustable. For example, parking lots will regularly use video surveillance to recognize license plate information which is later used for billing. During the day vehicle registration plate data is collected, and most cores can be used for storage. At night, these cores will be used to process the data for billing and will adjust to carry out the data analysis and machine learning needed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs storage controllers are becoming more diverse to address different markets and features, Cortex-R82 delivers an architecture to provide this extreme flexibility \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reducing costs and time to market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Werdmuller. Linux support is particularly important. According to Arm, the ability to run Linux gives developers a new set of software tools and technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, to use for their storage applications, providing an accelerated method of implementation. The Cortex-R82 also takes advantage of Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security foundations and is compatible with Arm TrustZone, ensuring isolation of the storage controller firmware from other Linux or real-time workloads.
