More than 700 exhibitors showed their next-generation offerings at the defense forum, which carried the theme of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ready Today, More Lethal Tomorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Ruggedization and weight-reduction proved to be key attributes in these new product introductions.\u00c2\u00a0 W. L. Gore & Associates \u00c2\u00a0introduced a lightweight cable option for tethered drones. The\u00c2\u00a0GORE Tethered Drone Cables  combine power and fiber-optic cables and durable, lighter-weight materials to maximize Tether Management System (TMS) availability; provide more design options and payload, and enable greater drone operational capability. The cables have a dielectric that is 20% smaller than standard nylon cables, and provide weight stability in harsh fluids.

The single-mode fiber-optic cable meets ARINC 802-2 requirements and are crush resistance with low insertion loss. Cannon and Enidine showed a range of interconnect, energy absorption and vibration isolation products for military and defense applications that support high-intensity conflict, multi-domain battle, and non-combat operations. \u201cOur connector and motion control solutions are designed for modern military applications that help keep our soldiers safe while enabling the performance and reliability of equipment and devices in the most extreme conditions and harshest environments,\u201d said Farrokh Batliwala, president of ITT's Connect and Controls Technology business.  The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highlighted a number of lightweight, reliable and high-performance interconnects for soldier-worn applications aimed at enhancing communication, increasing mobility and maximizing situational awareness. \u00c2\u00a0These include:  Cannon's\u00c2\u00a0Nemesis II CBA 20+ Meters high speed, high mating and quick termination interconnect, which designed and tested for water submersion to at 20+ Meters (65.6 feet) Cannon's\u00c2\u00a0Rock-in-Lock (RIL) Latching Connector, a flash-drive-sized, low-profile quick connect that can be attached to a helmet or tablet without any tools. Enidine hydraulic\u00c2\u00a0recoil buffers\u00c2\u00a0which help to absorb energy in soldier borne weapons.  Systel launched two new products at the show: Raven-Strike and HR3000.\u00c2\u00a0\u201cSystel's tactical capabilities support the Army's rapid prototyping initiatives and deployments for multi-domain operations,\u201d said\u00c2\u00a0Aneesh Kothari, vice president of marketing for Systel. \u201cBoth Raven-Strike and HR3000 are robust mission computers, purpose-built to meet the demands of modern fighting vehicles.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 Raven-Strike, a fully sealed and rugged system, boasts minimal SWaP-2C and maximum CPU and GPU core density.\u00c2\u00a0HR3000, a member of Systel's Puma-Bolt class space-saver server series, is a SWaP-2C optimized 3U rack-mount server featuring edge-computing processing power in a half-rack width, shor- depth form factor.
