Those efforts along with stiff U.S. export controls seek to blunt China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drive for an indigenous chip industry with a counteroffensive designed to retool fabs, build new ones and advance chip manufacturing capabilities ceded to Asian manufacturers over the last several decades. Despite bipartisan support for reviving U.S. chip manufacturing, observers note that research focused on next-generation chip technologies would be a better investment than subsidizing new U.S. fabs. The Pentagon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Electronics Resurgence Initiative looks beyond Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law scaling, but is heavily focused on weapons. Either way, legislation aimed at reviving the U.S. semiconductor sector and the industry lobbying campaign underscore a geopolitical reality: The American lead in chip technology is eroding. Industry groups including the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) have stepped up their efforts in recent days to push proposals like the CHIPS Act across the finish line. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe increasing expense, complexity and scale required to innovate and manufacture semiconductors means that no single nation or enterprise can go it alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d concludes a report\u00c2\u00a0released by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the face of challenges from China, allied cooperation in semiconductors is critical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Stephen Ezell, ITIF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president for global innovation policy and author of the report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith a reduced, shrinking manufacturing footprint, the U.S semiconductor industry would be challenged to stay at the forefront of further advances in manufacturing-processing technology, architectures and materials critical for developing the next generations of semiconductors that will make artificial intelligence or quantum computing possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d SIA added in a separate study. SIA counts 70 commercial chip fabs currently operating in the U.S. Those facilities account for an estimated 44.3 percent of domestic wafer capacity, much of it classified as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfront-end\u00e2\u0080\u009d chip manufacturing. Still, U.S.-based fabs produce only 12 percent of global chip output, down from 37 percent in 1990. SIA argues in its report that \u00e2\u0080\u009crobust federal incentives\u00e2\u0080\u009d would seed as many as 19 \u00e2\u0080\u009cmajor\u00e2\u0080\u009d semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the U.S. That would require U.S. manufacturing grants and tax breaks totaling as much as $50 billion, SIA asserted. ITIF, meanwhile, advocates a collaborative approach among western countries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike-minded nations should come together to open trade and fair economic competition and collaborate in ways that collectively empower the competitiveness of their respective semiconductor industries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ezell said. Some observers say the manufacturing emphasis is misguided. Chris Miller \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u2019s no doubt that more financial incentives would encourage more onshore manufacturing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chris Miller, assistant professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe question is whether that\u2019s the right way of defining the goal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cClearly a stronger semiconductor manufacturing\u00c2\u00a0base in the U.S. would be good for the entire ecosystem. But if I had to allocate funds to promote the U.S. chip industry over the long run, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear that our marginal dollar is best spent on subsidies for fabs.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c Miller cites the American exodus from the DRAM market in the 1980s as an example. Rather than subsidizing American memory makers, companies like Intel Corp. exited the memory sector to focus on emerging market like microprocessors. Intel and others \u00e2\u0080\u009cfocused on higher-value products, and cemented several decades of U.S. chip dominance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we think about bolstering the U.S. tech position, we need to consider where we have a competitive advantage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a recent New York Times op-ed, Miller argued the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecapitate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chinese telecommunications equipment vendor Huawei Technologies is another sign of eroding U.S. chip prowess. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWashington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leverage says more about America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past success than its future trajectory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller wrote. Moreover, he warned, hardball trade tactics aimed at Chinese companies could backfire: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe campaign against Huawei works only because other countries rely on American technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller asserted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow they have an incentive to diversify.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
