NIWeek is a red-letter event, throwing together thousands of scientists, engineers, and industry professions to learn about all things NI. NI is an extremely important company, particularly in the wireless space, because it is responsible for building the hardware and software for testing and measuring 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G. As such, it serves many big-name customers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Qualcomm, Samsung, and AT&T, to name a few. So much of the cool stuff happening right now in tech \u00e2\u0080\u0094 5G, IoT, self-driving cars, and machine learning \u00e2\u0080\u0094 wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be happening without state-of-the-art test and measurement equipment, and nobody does it as good as NI. NIWeek is the most engineer-rich event that I attend, which makes sense given the area of NI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise. The event features a variety of offerings such as training and certification opportunities, interactive technical sessions, and keynotes from industry thought leaders. The company also seized the opportunity to unveil several new offerings to its portfolio, which I wanted to spend some time talking about today. The latest, greatest LabVIEW edition  First, NI unveiled LabVIEW 2018, the latest iteration of its massively popular platform software for test workflows, which the company promises will enable engineers to increase the speed of their innovation. The latest version comes with new tools that NI says will simplify system integration and give more control using hardware accessibility. With LabVIEW 2018, engineers will be able to incorporate more third-party IP (for example, from tools like Python) and strengthen code reliability by automating software with open-interface tools. Additionally, LabVIEW 2018 features new deep-learning functions and improved floating-point operations that NI says will benefit engineers utilizing FPGAs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a growing demographic. FlexLogger data-logging software  Also announced at the event was FlexLogger, a new configuration-based data-logging software for validation test. FlexLogger enables automotive test departments to capture and document data to verify system functionality in real-world scenarios and ensure compliance with the rigid government regulations on the industry. With the increasing complexity of automotive components and systems, there is a corresponding demand for a higher volume of testing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with accurate, well-documented results. FlexLogger can simplify test configurations and extract insights with \u00e2\u0080\u009csensor-specific workflows to acquire and log synchronized, mixed measurements\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all without any programming required. NI is so successful in part because its portfolio features products that tailor to specific needs within specific workflow stages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I see FlexLogger as another incredibly useful tool in that vein. InstrumentStudio to develop and debug automated test systems  NI also announced InstrumentStudio, a new software offering for PXI modular instruments to allow engineers to more easily develop and debug automated test systems. The software enables engineers to take screenshots and measurement results of their entire suite of instruments in one view instead of the traditional single-instrument soft panels. The software unifies instruments into a multi-instrument environment, which should make test systems more efficient. InstrumentStudio features many capabilities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it can export configuration files to programming environments that reproduce settings, thus simplifying measurement correlation between similar tests that utilize different hardware. InstrumentStudio also enables engineers to monitor PXI instrument behavior while test sequences are simultaneously executed, streamlining the debugging process. ELVIS lives on  The last big announcement from the event was the unveiling of the NI Educational Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Suite (NI ELVIS) III. NI says ELVIS III \u00e2\u0080\u009cdelivers a platform designed to meet the specific needs of university engineering education.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ELVIS III is geared toward mechanical and electrical engineering project-based learning, combining instrumentation, embedded FPGA design, and web-based access to measurements and curriculum for an interactive, collaborative learning environment. ELVIS III\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application boards were designed by leading educators and industrial partners to better prepare students for real-world engineering scenarios. I also see this as beneficial (for both students and NI) because it gets prospective engineers hooked on and familiar with NI technology early on. Wrapping up  All in all, NIWeek 2018 was a great event \u00e2\u0080\u0094 informative and interesting. All of the new offerings look to be good additions to NI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio that will likely make the company even more invaluable to engineers. NI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software-driven platform is wide, deep, and open and becomes more so with every new product that the company brings to the table. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stress enough that no chips or devices for 5G, IoT, mobility, or autonomous vehicles would happen without the state-of-the-art testing systems that are NI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bread and butter. Keep up the good work, NI \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to watch with interest. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Patrick Moorhead is founder, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\u00a0  "}
