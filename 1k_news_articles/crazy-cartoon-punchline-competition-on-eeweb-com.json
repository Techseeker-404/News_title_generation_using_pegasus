In the old days of print magazines, when the new issue of EDN landed on my desk, the first thing I did was flick through the pages to find the Dilbert cartoon and have a laugh, after which I returned to the front of the magazine to peruse the contents page. Similarly, decades ago as I pen these words, the print edition of EE Times used to have a weekly competition called Immortal Works that often featured a picture of a classic oil painting. The idea was to come up with a funny caption, and some of the offerings were very funny indeed. As an aside, if anyone still has any hard-copies of those issues, it would be great if you could scan some of those Immortal Works images and captions and post them here in the comments. These days, of course, we have our monthly cartoon caption competitions, I\u2019m still laughing over the winning entry for the December 2016 competition.  The reason I mention all of this here is that \u2014 as you may know \u2014 I recently became Editor in Chief at EEWeb.com. Since I enjoy the cartoon caption competition on EETimes.com so much, I decided that it would be nice to do something similar on EEWeb.com. Of course, there\u2019s no fun in doing the same thing on both sites. Thus, as opposed to a cartoon caption competition, I decided we should have a cartoon punchline contest. The idea is that each strip will feature two engineers \u2014 Bob and Betsy \u2014 having a conversation. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to propose an appropriate punchline for the final frame. Our inaugural cartoon strip is shown below. How do you think Betsy should respond to Bob?  We\u2019ve already had some rather good offerings \u2014 as you will see if you Click Here to bounce over to the competition page on EEWeb.com \u2014 but I\u2019m sure you can come up with something equally amusing of your own. The winner, who will be selected at the end of the month, will receive a full-size version of the cartoon adorned with the winning punchline and signed by the artist. I await your submissions in dread anticipation \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082 Related posts:  Revel in Thought-Provoking Presentations at ESC Boston 2017 Renting/Leasing Electronic Test Equipment It\u2019s Raining Americans (Better Take an Umbrella) Networking Furiously at ESC Boston 2017 Want More Pi?
