Cognitive scientists have long known this phenomenon and have been studying it for decades. They call it \u00e2\u0080\u009cmind wandering.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They talk about people getting hit by a train of thought that mentally disengages them from an attention-demanding task like reading, a face-to-face meeting, or, most important of all, driving. To understand the cognitive state of a human brain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or the mental status of a human driver at any given moment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is believed to be the next frontier for driver-monitoring systems (DMS). Think of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 cars with partially automated driver assistance systems. Even when your hands are on the wheel (as Tesla reminds you to do), your head is erect, and your eyes are open and staring at the street ahead, your brain could be picking daisies in La La Land. When this happens, how can a machine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 your car \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recognize your impaired condition? What actions should it be programmed to take? To some people, the DMS is an unglamorous, old-school, \u00e2\u0080\u009cboring\u00e2\u0080\u009d technology. They even ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy DMS, with Level 4 autonomous vehicles hitting the home stretch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such notions, however, couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be further from the current state of the art, according to Colin Barnden, Semicast Research lead analyst. Ever since Euro NCAP, a voluntary vehicle safety rating system, made the driver-monitoring system a primary safety standard by 2020 in Euro NCAP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Roadmap, car OEMs and Tier Ones are mobilizing DMS in every Level 2 car by 2020, explained Barnden. He believes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe moment automation comes into a vehicle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d regardless of autonomy level, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to introduce DMS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Recommended   Driver Monitoring: \u2018Shut Up, Mom, I See It!\u2019   The market already has a host of DMS technologies from companies such as Seeing Machines (Canberra, Australia), Smart Eye AB (Gothenburg, Sweden), Affectiva (Boston) and FotoNation (San Jose, California). An Israel-based startup called ADAM is poised to join the club, claiming that it is the first to add a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccognition\u00e2\u0080\u009d layer to traditional driver-monitoring systems. The startup is at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cproof-of-concept\u00e2\u0080\u009d stage for many of the features to be embedded into its adaptive driver attention management (ADAM) platform. However, Seeing Machines, for example, has amassed voluminous data on drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior through 18 years of \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman factor\u00e2\u0080\u009d R&D activities. So Barnden is skeptical that ADAM is truly the first with a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccognitive layer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he acknowledged that leading DMS technologies will no longer be about measuring just one thing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as measuring head position, eye gaze, or eyelid closure. Instead, \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman factors\u00e2\u0080\u009d need to consider a variety of parameters. Why ADAM?  EE Times caught up with Carl Pickering, former global lead of Jaguar Land Rover Automated Driving HMI and head of Research and Technology Strategy, who was announced this week as ADAM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO. ADAM is working on adaptive driver attention management platform. (Source: ADAM)  In an exclusive phone interview with EE Times, Pickering explained that he decided to join ADAM after 20 years with JLR because it is the first company that he has found with a critical technology that he had long sought at his previous company. In developing HMI for cars, critically important to a scientist/engineer is knowing \u00e2\u0080\u009chow best to measure the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workload.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A carmaker could decide on the adoption of hand gestures, handwriting, or voice recognition for its man-machine interface. But in evaluating each, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must be able to measure the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manual workload as the driver tinkers with switches and knobs in a car and visual workload as the driver looks at the road ahead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pickering. The third element that comes into play is the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccognitive workload\u00e2\u0080\u009d that a driver must bear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut really, how could we measure that? I had not been able to figure it out until I met a team at ADAM in Israel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d AI algorithms  ADAM, established barely a year ago, consists of 10 people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mostly cognitive scientists and AI experts. Combined, \u00e2\u0080\u009cADAM has roughly 15 years of experience in both fields,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pickering told us. The team has examined \u00e2\u0080\u009ca complex set of parameters\u00e2\u0080\u009d including eye gaze, pupil dilation, eyelid closures, blink rate, and others to discern a driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cognitive level. To set a baseline for cognition level \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which varies from one person to another \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the team has used AI and developed algorithms. With this, ADAM can measure the deviation from a driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s baseline cognition level on an individual basis. While acknowledging that all of these algorithms are still in the lab, Pickering said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I first saw how they are measuring the cognitive workload, I was blown away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
