The explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, said moderator Ian Hughes, an IoT analyst for 451 Research, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas created a massive ballooning of risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the security of systems dependent on Internet communications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe proliferation of IoT devices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rashni Misra, Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general manager for IoT and AI solutions, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas basically opened a new surface for attack, to an extraordinary degree.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The message offered by a parade of experts at the Mobile World session was that security is finally an issue that big companies are taking seriously, but that the solutions today are more theoretical than actual, and they will require a measure of mutual trust (socialism?) unusual among high-tech competitors (capitalists). However, none of the experts was sanguine about the exclusively software approach, such as blockchains, which originally emerged as a decentralized transaction ledger for the crypto-currency Bitcoin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t base all your security in software,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said analyst Seshu Madhavapeddy, Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of IoT product management.

Williamson noted that danger no longer applies to devices when they are launched. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to think about how devices can be managed throughout their lives in this world of IoT,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Linch, of Syniverse, emphasized the potential impact of a security breach in massive systems, like high-speed trains and hospital networks, but Jaya Baloo, chief information security officer at KPN Telecom, characterizing her company as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccustomer\u00e2\u0080\u009d of security systems, took the issue down to the smallest devices. She cited the case of Fitbit users in Somalia. Their activities were monitored and fed to the Internet by a built-in monitoring system that kept track of data like mileage run and heart-rate levels. By tuning in to the network and finding an unusual concentration of Fitbit data emanating from a remote region in East Africa, unauthorized observers correctly determined that this fitness cluster, a lot of people working out, was the location of what had been a secret military base.\u00c2\u00a0 Baloo noted that this breach was not a bug, nor did it require a sophisticated hack. It was a flaw intentionally built in by its designers, a \u00e2\u0080\u009csharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d feature. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are designing devices who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know enough to anticipate bugs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d lamented Baloo. Among solutions suggested during the Mobile World session was a Blockchain IoT Registry, described by Anoop Nannra, chairman at Cisco of the Trusted IoT Alliance and head of its Blockchain Initiatives. He said each IoT system\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as drug delivery by drone\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 could be secured by \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart contracts that define a common model for IoT devices in a registry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Anoop Nannra, Chairman at Cisco of the Trusted IoT Alliance (Photo: EE Times)  He laid out a program, incorporating both hardware and software protections, for each IoT \u00e2\u0080\u009casset\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 a \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart truck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 that would include a) registration, b) verification, c) transfer security, d) a secure ledger system and e) a digital wallet to pay for and get paid for services. But this is where, said Baloo, the truck hits the road. Proposing standards, registries, alliances and trust are the easy part of Internet security, especially in the industrial realm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have failed at everything, at every single level,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe standards are there, but our implementation of them sucks. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other way to put it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She offered another real-world example, in which high-tech medical devices were carefully and strictly registered to prevent a security breach. But the machines then rejected the remote software updates that they needed. It seems that if the device was opened to allow the new software, the security protocol would rescind the certification that was necessary to permit its use. Baloo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own company hired a team of white-hat hackers to attack its just-finished, state-of-the-art security system. The hackers discovered a flaw in the protocol standard that rendered the system vulnerable and in need of massive repairs. She added that most companies have neither the resources nor the wits to hire teams of hackers to test security quite so intensely. The bottom line, which was left to Baloo, the final speaker, is that IoT security has a long way to go. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDefense in depth actually requires us to do just that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrust, but always be in a position to verify.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094Journalist  David Benjamin is a special correspondent for EE Times.
