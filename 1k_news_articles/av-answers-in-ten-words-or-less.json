Every time I hear his name, I feel such a sense of pride that I start welling up. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sophistication of his arguments, his compassion for the American people and his sense of responsibility for public office. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watch one of his finest speeches. No, not the real guy, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Jed Bartlet from The West Wing.  If ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns, then two words is all it takes to shut down the autonomous vehicle (AV) safety debate: Saving lives. Who could possibly argue with that? Now just add in the issues of diversity, inclusivity and access to mobility for disadvantaged citizens and it is all over. Game, set and match to AVs, right? No so fast. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one tiny problem no one talks about: Robotaxis don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. If the goal of new mobility services is to achieve diversity, inclusivity and accessibility using technologies which don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, then limiting the debate to robotaxis shows a real paucity of ambition. I propose teleportation, which saves lives, saves time and saves the environment. How did the political lobbyists miss that one? Some days I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not clear if Waymo Driver is a product or someone campaigning for office. We know human drivers kill more than 1.3 million people globally each year, with more than 38,000 lives lost annually on U.S. roadways. We know the goal is to save lives. But isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it time we started to ask precisely what the AV industry is offering, beyond non-functioning technology, missed timescales and savvy political messaging? Two-word answers Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forget about all the political positioning and all the technical jargon and just go back to basics. What is the purpose of transportation? It is a simple question that can be reduced to a two-word answer: Moving stuff. What stuff? People and goods. Throughout history, from the horse, through maritime, rail, the motor car, aviation to micro-mobility the role of transportation has been to move people and goods. Today, all AV technology development can be segmented into those two groups. EE Times has written extensively about AVs and discusses four categories: Last-mile goods AVs, fixed-route AVs, autonomous trucks, and robotaxis. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to understand anything about technology to understand that smaller, lighter and slower AVs present the lowest risk, which is why we are set to see deployment of last-mile goods AVs enter operation first.\u00c2\u00a0 Common sense tells us that if a small, slow-speed goods AV crashes and spoils a cargo of, say, hot pizza, that is just a cost of business. In comparison if a people-AV crashes and kills its human cargo and maybe some pedestrians too, that is a legal nightmare in which we can be certain every party involved will look to pin the blame on someone else. For the foreseeable future, that \u00e2\u0080\u009csomeone else\u00e2\u0080\u009d looks set to be the primary role of the hapless safety driver. Behind the soundbites and euphoria of the AV proponents and all the political posturing is a cold, hard reality that goods AVs will enter safe operation and commercial viability years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and possibly decades \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ahead of people AVs. Saving pizzas doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t generate quite the same buzz on Capitol Hill as saving lives, but my role here is just to state the obvious, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave the messaging to Waymo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications team to work on. How are we going to save lives? If the solution to the conundrum of human drivers killing more than 38,000 people on U.S. roadways each year isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t AVs, then what is it? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another two-word answer: Effective legislation. To understand more about what can be done to save lives safely, quickly and broadly, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refer to the safety technologies covered by the updated EU General Safety Regulation (GSR), summarized in the slide below, which features in Continental\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2019 Fact Book. Click the image to enlarge. (Source: Continental) From 2022 the EU GSR requires privately-owned passenger vehicles to be fitted with advanced emergency braking (AEB), emergency lane keeping, intelligent speed assistance, event (accident) data recorder, alcohol interlock facilitation, drowsiness/attention detection and driver readiness monitor. From 2024 the legislation further requires the installation of advanced distraction recognition systems. As EE Times reported this week, a lack of ADAS benchmarks is haunting the U.S. car industry, while Bloomberg reported on \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Life-Saving Car Technology No One Wants.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Both articles address the same issue: Life-saving technology which is covered by effective legislation in the EU, but isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t required in the U.S. Most of these critical life-saving technologies are included in the Moving Forward Act currently passing through Congress and I am unaware of even a single AV tech company which has publicly backed the provisions for saving lives in the Act. Perhaps these companies are interested in saving lives only if it uses their technology? How are we going to save lives? By making human drivers safer with driver monitoring and assistance technology. That means ADAS-focused tier one suppliers like Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Magna, Veoneer and ZF; camera and radar sensor suppliers like Analog Devices, Infineon and On Semiconductor; processor suppliers like Mobileye (Intel), NXP, Renesas, Texas Instruments, Toshiba and Xilinx; and DMS software suppliers like Eyesight, Seeing Machines and Smart Eye. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ten-word answer President Bartlet might approve of: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSafer roadways using effective technology that is affordable and works.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Over to you NHTSA.
