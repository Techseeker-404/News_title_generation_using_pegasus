Knowing accurate distances, for example, can augment position tracking in VR/AR headsets, and prevent robotic vacuum cleaners from running into walls or objects. Although the market has already seen time-of-flight (ToF) sensors built on different technologies\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as IR and optical \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Chirp Microsystems believes its new MEMS-based millimeter-sized ultrasound chip will become an effective alternative to the competition. Chirp boasts that it operates at ultra-low power with high precision range. It stands up to harsher environments while working both in total darkness and under the full sun, according to the company.
