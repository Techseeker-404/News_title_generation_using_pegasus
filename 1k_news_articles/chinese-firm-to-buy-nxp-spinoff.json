Wingtech bills itself as the world's largest contract manufacturer of smartphones. Reuters reported that the deal will be subject to regulatory review, including approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the powerful multi-agency committee that reviews transactions for potential national security concerns. Over the past two years, as tensions between the U.S. and China have grown, CFIUS has been weary of approving the acquisition of U.S. and Western companies by Chinese firms. Notably, a potential deal by a Chinese investment firm to acquire Lattice Semiconductor was struck down last year by U.S. President Donald Trump  after CFIUS recommended against it.
