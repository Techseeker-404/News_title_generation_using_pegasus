As it touches nearly every facet of life, educators must consider the broader impact of technology on society.  We again survey the engineering education landscape with a sharper focus on how technologies like AI and machine learning are reshaping college curricula. They are also presenting educators with new sets of challenges. Loring Wirbel takes a deep dive into those educational opportunities and conundrums, including how professions in the computer science domain are moving from traditional programming to what Wirbel calls \u00e2\u0080\u009csimple expansion of high-level software languages in vertical domains\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as deep learning and neural networks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan universities keep pace with the fast-moving disciplines?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asks the author.   This special project explores AI and engineering education. New technologies like AI and machine learning feel like a boon to universities wishing to update their STEM curricula. But we predict academia will hit fundamental speed bumps in coming years in their efforts to develop effective criteria.  Wirbel also examines the emerging data privacy issues that will complicate the work of university researchers seeking to glean insights from open-source databases. The use of those \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic\u00e2\u0080\u009d data sets is fraught with privacy issues and potential legal and ethical issues. Our engineering education package also explores the movement toward \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreen AI,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so called because the programming approach looks for ways to reduce energy consumption related to the huge amounts of computing power required to train neural networking and other models. Wirbel reports that university researchers could play a key role in implementing the Green AI approach. We take another look at the critical role of community colleges in certifying technical workers who either can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford a four-year engineering degree or simply cannot get gain a coveted spot at crowded state university campuses. The California Community College System has led the nation in developing course work that meets the needs of companies that often complain of a skills gap. The system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice chancellor of workforce and economic development described for us how it is meeting those challenges and how it is scaling its efforts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChange Your Life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clarion call, serving what looks to us like a template for training the next generation of American workers. Across the pond, worried UK educators are proposing updated engineering courses that reflect students\u2019 growing passion for AI. Part of the reason is that British university engineering departments are losing candidates to computer science at an accelerating rate. Sally Ward-Foxton in London explains. We conclude our AI and Engineering Special Project with a slideshow sampling of the increasing number of AI courses being offered as part of undergradate engineering degree programs. Check out all the stories inside this Apple Special Project.      What Does the Rise of AI Hold for Engineering Education?  AI and Machine learning look easy to exploit for universities wishing to update their STEM curricula. But we predict the contrary.     Facing the Privacy Conundrum in Public Databases  Public databases pose privacy concerns for university researchers. Will it hinder their work?     \u00e2\u0080\u0098Green AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Could Give Academia a Much-Needed Edge  The Allen Institute urges university researchers to leave computing- and energy-intensive AI application development to corporate hyperscalers. Instead, researchers should focus on AI efficiency frameworks.     Training the Workforce of the Future  Community colleges are striving to help companies fill skills gaps. Educators say Corporate America must meet them halfway.     Reimagining Engineering Education Around AI  UK educators worried about losing more engineering candidates to popular computer science majors are seeking to refresh engineering curricula.     Slideshow: More Colleges are Offering AI Courses Toward Degrees We provide a survey of AI courses and degrees offered by colleges.      How EEs Can Stay Relevant   A focus on problem solving can be applied beyond engineering, as can a willingness to leave your comfort zone.      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
