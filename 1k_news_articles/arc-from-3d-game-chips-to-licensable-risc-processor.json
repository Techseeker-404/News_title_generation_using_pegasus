On 21st September 2000, the 32-bit configurable RISC processor company ARC International, now an integral part of Synopsys, completed a major milestone in its history: an IPO (initial public offering) on the London Stock Exchange, at a first day market valuation of around \u00c2\u00a31.1 billion. A newspaper cutting highlighting ARC\u2019s IPO That was a huge achievement for all concerned, but for me it was extra special, because it was the culmination of an objective set by the two people, founder Rick Clucas and CEO Bob Terwilliger, who recruited me as part of the early team of 20 or so people at Argonaut RISC Cores as it was called then, in July 1998. When I visited them for my \u00e2\u0080\u0098interview\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the Argonaut Software building in Edgware, north of London, where there was a large cutout of one the big Nintendo games they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d produced (I believe it was Star Fox) in the lobby, the speed with which startups can make decisions meant I was already offered the \u00e2\u0080\u0098job\u00e2\u0080\u0099. That same evening, pleased that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d agreed to join, Bob took me to dinner in a well-known Indian restaurant in the center of London, and set me my target: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to do an IPO in two years, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to help us do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told me. That sounded quite exciting, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually know what it meant. At that point I was quite na\u00c3\u00afve, as the concept of startups, stock options and IPOs were completely new to me. I had worked for large companies before, like National Semiconductor, Marconi Instruments, and GEC Plessey Semiconductor. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know much about RISC processors, apart from meeting Robin Saxby of ARM a few times on my travels to the USA when I was with my previous company. But that was about it. ARC had an interesting history, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d discovered only after I left the company in 2002. It was founded by Rick Clucas and Jez San. Jez is widely known for his success in the games software industry with Argonaut Software, which is where ARC effectively spun out from. Speaking to me last week for this story, Rick said the first form of the ARC processor was actually developed in 1993, and the first licensing deal was with Brooktree in 1996. Prior to the first licensee, the company in several different guises had developed precursors of the ARC processor. First was the Super FX chip for Nintendo; Jez is said to have received $1 million from Nintendo when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d turned up in Japan and told them they could develop a hardware accelerator chip that would speed up one of their 3D games by 200 times over the software-based system they were using at the time. In an interview with Nintendo Life magazine last year, Jez described how Nintendo had a standard DSP chip that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really help them with the graphics so was limited. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were very forward-thinking with the Super FX chip, because what we designed wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a hardwired polygon engine, it was a fully programmable RISC microprocessor. We had the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first GPU years before anyone else had done it, because it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just the polygons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we could do 3D mapping on it, we could do pixel shading on it\u2026 we could do anything, except it only ran on 21MHz.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After this, Argonaut worked with Hasbro on a chip using three ARC processors for a VR games console, a project which was eventually canned. Next came an assignment for Philips to design a 3D chip for the CD-I 2. And then when that project was canned by Philips, Argonaut designed a 3D chip for a joint venture between Apple and Toshiba for a games console being developed by the Apple Pie division. That also got canned. Jez said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were getting annoyed with these hardware companies hiring us to do really cool hardware and then it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come out, because we were just the engineers working on their product; we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any say in how it got launched or marketed or anything like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, according to Rick, since the projects were stopped, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe got the rights back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The processor was actually invented by James Hakewill, with support from Jon Sanders.

(Image: Nitin Dahad) So, by the time I joined, there was some history, but by then it had really got to being a proper intellectual property licensing company, through the dedicated hardware spinout, Argonaut RISC Cores. For me it was a roller-coaster of a journey. I began to understand the culture of a startup before startups were even in vogue. For example, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no demarcation of roles. I might have been hired as a director of worldwide communications, but that was just in name only. You did everything: from going out with the CEO and fundraising, to doing the trade shows, organizing graphics, building the exhibition stands, writing press releases, sending out the press releases, building advertising campaigns, writing the brochures and ad copy, hiring people, making the coffee and much more. That principle didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply just for me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the CEO, the CTO, the engineers, the salespeople, all chip in when you are just 20 or so people trying to build a company. For example, we did many trade shows in the U.S. and Europe. So many that I was traveling to California on a \u00e2\u0080\u0098commuting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 basis almost every other week for two years from London. Bob, Rick and I would have competitions on how fast we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d build our exhibition booth or tear it down (it was a pop-up but big enough to require some effort and packing) and get to the airport. Between the three of us and Tim Holden in Europe, David Toombs in the U.S. and Jason Good for both the U.S. and Europe, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be in and out of trade shows and conferences, pitching the ARC processor, evangelizing the possibilities of a configurable 32-bit RISC processor and building our partners and networks. And even the engineering team back home got involved in everything \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from developing the demos, to helping pack and ship brochures and flyers. When you do so many things, there are not enough hours in the day. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d often still be in the office at 9:30pm London time talking to the likes of partners and media in California. In my first month, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d generated headlines in the media like front page stories that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cARC challenges ARM,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d spent a week in Sand Hill Road, California, pitching the ARC proposition with Bob and Rick to all the big investors there. We made a classic mistake when pitching to Silicon Valley investors. We showed them how cool the ARC processor was, with a demo on the laptop showing how anyone could easily configure a processor with whatever instructions you wanted using check boxes on our \u00e2\u0080\u0098wizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099 graphic user interface (a name we changed to Architect because another company used \u00e2\u0080\u0098wizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099), and then automatically generate the RTL code. The story would have been better received if we talked more about how the benefits of the configurability would have been enough for customers to change their processor. Despite that \u00e2\u0080\u0098failed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trip to Sand Hill Road, the London-based investors continued to invest in ARC. One of the first people to invest was Tom Teichman, through NewMedia Investors, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also invested in Argonaut Games and Lastminute.com. Others early investors included Apax Partners and Nomura, who were able to cash out handsomely on the IPO. There were some huge challenges as a startup with big-name licensees that couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be named. How could you let the market know? Strict non-disclosure agreements meant you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use them as reference names for others to have confidence in signing up with you. I remember in 1998 telling the world in our PR and our web site that we had some 18 licensees but could name only three or four of them. In this respect, credit goes to good reporters in digging for a story. At that time EE Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 European correspondent Peter Clarke often kept pressing the company to give licensee names, otherwise the story would sound rather hollow (my words not his). It was at the IP 98 show in Frankfurt, Germany, when Peter persisted in asking Bob for names. Peter doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give up in finding the real story, which is one of the characteristics many startups have recognized as a huge benefit when he tells their stories. Next we knew, Peter had published a story after the show deducing Intel was a licensee. That public outage of a licensee didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go down too well with Intel, but it was out in public. ARC\u2019s logo changed several times As media coverage grew, recruiting became easy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everyone wanted to work for this rising new startup called ARC Cores (the name changed several times, from Argonaut RISC Cores, to ARC Cores, to ARC International pre-IPO). And because it was the dot-com boom period, even though this was hardware rather than software, the money kept flowing too. It ended up that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d raised well over \u00c2\u00a3100 million in cash, and that was before the IPO. It felt like a juggernaut that couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be stopped, it seemed we had the Midas touch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everything just turned into money. After announcing a \u00c2\u00a35 million+ fundraise in December 1998, another interesting break came: on a U.S. press tour just before Christmas, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d attracted interest from one of the biggest names in the microprocessor world, Jim Turley. That was a coup, and effectively I was instrumental in hiring my own boss! It had to be kept a strict secret though, as Jim used to run the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flagship event, the Microprocessor Forum in San Jose, California. He was to announce he was joining ARC after that. But even that secrecy was discovered by our friendly neighborhood reporter, Peter Clarke. From the windows overlooking the street from the conference, he had spotted Jim and I having a private chat on a bench in the space just outside the Fairmont hotel in San Jose. He wondered why and expectedly produced an incisive story in EE Times. With a high-caliber team in place, backed by strong engineering and support, ARC also started acquiring companies to support the value proposition. It acquired MetaWare in Santa Cruz, VAutomation in Nashua, New Hampshire, and Precise Software Technologies in Ottawa. The company clearly went through growing pains. As a startup with few people it seemed easier as everyone was on a shared mission and things appeared to run smoothly. But as the company grew, that same culture was difficult to maintain, and becomes even more challenging when operationally there was an attempt to integrate teams from acquisitions in three different locations. Somehow though we had the right people there to help achieve the objective set by the CEO when I joined: to do an IPO in two years. We had luck on our side, riding on the back of the dot com boom. And ARC International was one of the last hardware IPOs of that boom period. While the share price crashed spectacularly over the next two years, the ARC processor, now under the Synopsys umbrella, along with the likes of Tensilica under Cadence and MIPS, is still considered to be one of the next best-selling RISC processors behind ARM, even if it a long way behind. And many of those colleagues from pre-IPO are now at companies like ARM, and Imagination Technologies, as well as Active Silicon, GUC, Huawei, Tesla V-Nova and Verifyter among others. I am pleased to have been a part of that process of bringing the company to market. Happy IPO anniversary to ARC.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
