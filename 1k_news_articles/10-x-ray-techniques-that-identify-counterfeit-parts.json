As OEMs scramble to get the parts they need, they are increasingly likely to turn to less reliable sources, providing an opportunity for counterfeiters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShortages go in cycles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robin Gray, chief counsel of the Electronic Component Industry Association (ECIA). \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor years, it was tantalum capacitors but not its many types of passives, including multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), as well as certain semiconductors. A key takeaway is that when times are good, lead times are always pushed out. When that happens, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of an opportunity for counterfeiters to step in and [counterfeit a] product.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The problem of fake parts is massive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCurrent estimates for the annual loss to the electronics industry due to counterfeit components is north of $5 billion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bill Cardoso, CEO at Creative Electron, in an article on EE Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister publication EBN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith rewards that high, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise that criminal enterprises are getting more and more sophisticated in their efforts to cash in on counterfeit parts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the past, when components were in short supply, component makers scrambled to add capacity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of manufacturers added capacity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gray. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe forecast on demand didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pan out, so they overbuilt and flooded the market, and everybody got burned by excess inventory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Once burned is twice shy for many component makers and distributors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis time around, you see more reluctance on the part of manufacturers to expand capacity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Gray. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFurthermore, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see average selling prices (ASPs) go up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Component makers should be aware of the dangers of short-stock situations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne mistake involves not properly identifying where or how products are leaking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kasia Maciola, communications committee chair for the Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement (AGMA). \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t simply focus your business on selling, selling, selling by dumping everything into the market as cheaply as possible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 instead, try to establish healthy sales and high margins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Engineers, then, are faced with a dilemma: Should they stick with known parts and sources and put up with delays, or look for a different route to get the product they need? Gray advises that OEMs stick with franchised sources. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe new standard, particularly for aerospace, is that they have to buy authorized sources first. We tell people that you have to plan for obsolescence, which is another cause of shortages. Work with key manufacturers to understand their technology roadmap as much as possible. If a product is going away, make a one-time buy or partner with a distributor or authorized aftermarket manufacturer. Requalification is expensive and causes time delays, and even a new part upgrade requires that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buyers should encourage their organization to put a compliance program in place in consultation with corporate attorneys who understand the issues and challenges involved, said Maciola. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also crucial to educate distributors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and to hold them accountable if they should engage in any gray market activity. In addition, there is a role for regulators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to create laws that protect both consumers and brand owners. While there are some laws in place, there is work to be done in this area.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If using a non-franchised source, testing is also important. It is not, however, foolproof. In one test, which occurred several years ago, a major component manufacturer picked five testing houses and sent out a mix of counterfeit and genuine parts, explained Gray. These testers missed one out of five counterfeits. However, much work is being done to improve these technologies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs an industry, we must step up our efforts and meet this problem head-on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cardoso. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to leverage more sophisticated solutions. X-ray is one of several tools that can be deployed to combat the counterfeiters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Click on the image below to start a slideshow on EBN, authored by Cardoso, of 10 ways that X-ray technology can help OEMs identify counterfeit parts in their supply. 10 X-Ray Techniques That Identify Counterfeit Parts     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hailey Lynne McKeefry, Editor-in-Chief,  EBN              Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
