Can conventional ECUs\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 presumably hundreds already packed into a single vehicle\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 handle this digital mob scene? The short answers are no, and no. On one hand, carmakers are now tasked to enable a host of new features\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 including connectivity, over-the-air updates, sensory data and autonomy\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 never before offered in vehicles.\u00c2\u00a0 On the other hand, traditional ECUs were primarily designed to perform a specific, static, real-time function. Making ECUs future-proof wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really on Detroit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind in the past. This is where Autosar (AUTOmotive Open System Architecture)\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emerging standard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdaptive Automotive Platform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d comes in. Autosar, a global consortium of carmakers, tier ones and tech suppliers, has been working on a new standard for a new vehicle architecture. Its goal is to offer more flexible options for ECU architecture, to establish a foundation for more compute-intensive tasks with large amounts of data. Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for Vision Systems Intelligence (VSI), described Adaptive Autosar as \u00e2\u0080\u009crepresenting a new architecture that will be necessary to support the software-defined functionality of new vehicles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo function properly, [such] highly automated vehicles require number-crunching algorithms that will rely on \u00e2\u0080\u0098services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098data\u00e2\u0080\u0099 while at the same time retain the proven dependability of classic Autosar components.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  First commercial implementation The final spec for Autosar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Adaptive Automotive Platform isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expected until early 2018. However, Elektrobit, an Erlangen, Germany-based supplier of embedded and connected software for the auto industry, has jumped the gun. On Wednesday (Oct. 18), Elektrobit announced a new software product line, called EB Corbos, that adheres to Autosar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emerging Adaptive Automotive Platform.  Walter Sullivan, head of innovation at Elektrobit, told EE Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been missing in the automotive industry is the standard programming environment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Designers could make automotive applications to run on hardware processing-limited ECUs, but had not made a platform on which software could be reused, with safety and liability enforcement. Magney explained the difference with Adaptive Automotive Platform: Unlike the existing Autosar spec (called Classic Autosar Platform), \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe configuration is no longer static at compile time. Configuration is done at runtime.\u00c2\u00a0 The new model clearly supports a contemporary client\u00e2\u0080\u0093server architecture where tasks and processes are distributed among multiple clients. Furthermore, C++ is the main programming language for Adaptive Autosar applications, another sign that automotive is moving in the right direction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sullivan claimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cElektrobit is the first to offer commercially available software implementations of Adaptive Automotive Platform standard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Just to be clear, though, Elektrobit isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually rolling out EB Corbos until early next year.
