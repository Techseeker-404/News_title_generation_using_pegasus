After establishing a new high-water mark for revenue in 2017 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 growing by more than 20% and passing the $400 billion mark for the first time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 market watchers are predicting more market expansion for 2018. Some parts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly memory chips \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are in short supply, lead times are getting longer across the board, and chip suppliers have found amid boom times a swagger that seemed to have been missing for years. What's more, even as PC shipments continue to spiral downward, prospects for the future look bright, with evermore semiconductor content being designed into cars and technologies associated with artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things opening up whole new swaths of applications. It's the best of times, right? Except that anyone who has been around the semiconductor industry for any length of time is just kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop. Inevitably, healthy cynicism tells us, euphoria will lead chipmakers to expand production capacity too fast, lead times will shrink, market drivers will stall, and the industry will suddenly find itself in that dreaded state of overcapacity. The sunlight of prosperity will slip below the horizon, plunging the industry into another dark, dreary downturn. Except maybe not. Maybe not quite so suddenly, not quite so severely, and maybe not quite as quickly as it has before. What if, thanks to the rise of IoT and the hunger for electronics and connectivity in virtually everything , this time really is different? That's a theory subscribed to by Matt Anderson, president and chief digital officer at Arrow Electronics. (Full disclosure: Arrow is the parent company of AspenCore, the publisher of EE Times.) Matt Anderson  \u201cI think things are different this time,\u201d Anderson told us in a recent interview. \u201cI think there's going to be a need for more electronics everywhere, and it's going to fuel maybe a different length of cycle. Maybe it's a slow, steady, gradual building of a new industry, which is the internet-enabled anything.\u201d By now, we have all been so inundated by the IoT hype cycle that we view with a grain of salt any predictions about its potential to do everything from alleviating traffic congestion to saving the whales. IoT may actually make trains run on time, but can it really have a moderating effect on the inherent cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry? "}
