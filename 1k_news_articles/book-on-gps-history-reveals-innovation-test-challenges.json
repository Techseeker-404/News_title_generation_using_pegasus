This is true of the Global Positioning System (GPS), which took only a few decades to go from a just-proven concept to a key building block for both countless mass-market and highly specialized applications. (Note that the first launch of the \u201cofficial\u201d GPS system satellite occurred about 40 years ago in June 1977.) That's why I enjoyed the recently published book \u201cPinpoint: How GPS is Changing Technology, Culture, and Our Minds\u201d by Greg Milner, with its interesting history and perspective into the development of GPS.    \u201cPinpoint\u201d is actually two books in one: The first half is about the people who conceived of the system and made it happen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and there are lots of them along the way \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while the second half is more of a sociological look at the impact of ubiquitous GPS on individuals and society (my interests are much more toward the first half).    A few points in the book stand out:  The first GPS test-of-concept had used only one satellite (launched in 1977), so the results were approximate, but it proved that the idea could work. Can you imagine the joy of the team as their prototype receiver (which was largely untestable without a real GPS signal to receive) was able to capture, demodulate, and decode the signal despite dismal SNR and many other unknowns and obstacles? (It's one of the classic test-and-measurement issues: What do you use to test the first of anything, and how do you do so with confidence? How do you validate the test equipment itself?) The military originally felt that GPS was unneeded because they already had an extremely accurate inertial navigation system for missiles and aircraft, but the first Gulf War (1991) changed that view, as early GPS units were critical to troops in the featureless desert. Understanding the implications of what GPS provides also required a major mind shift from focusing on \u201cguide us (or a missile) to the designated destination\u201d (guidance) to answering the question of \u201cwhere are we now?\u201d (navigation) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is a very different issue and brings new, major implications. One of the first GPS receivers weighed several hundred pounds and was tested on the road by being put in the trunk of a car while driving around and comparing GPS results to the roadmap. (GPS receivers are now so small and lightweight that they are embedded in wristwatches and drones!) The differences in implementation between the less-accurate C/A-coded signal and the much more accurate P coding involved some clever theory and techniques and were soon targets of efforts to defeat the more precise coding stream. GPS now plays a major role in providing precise, worldwide timing-signal distribution and synchronization for fixed-in-place networks, an unforeseen and unintended benefit.      At its core, this story of GPS history is much more than a tale of hardware and software. It's also about the many determined individuals who thought of and pushed the concept and its physical implementation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often despite people and organizations that were very skeptical for technical reasons, didn't see the need for the function, or were unwilling to take the risk. Some of these efforts to make it happen were in the mode of under-the-radar \u201cskunk works,\u201d but even those could only go so far. After all, you don't get to launch a rocket with a prototype GPS transmitter without major buy-in at many levels. There are also the engineers and teams who designed and marketed the early commercial GPS receivers, each taking a different tack and emphases in their business plan; you'll see names such as Garmin, Magellan, and Trimble.     Finally, the book also provides some insight into the largely unknown U.S. Air Force's Schriever Air Force Base (Colorado) that is responsible for the ongoing care and management of the system. This work does not end when the satellites are launched and in orbit: There is continuous monitoring of their health, performance, countless tiny yet critical corrections to their orbits and internal atomic clocks, plus many other things that require 24/7/365 attention. (Another example of 1 + 1 = 3 synergy: We would not have viable GPS without atomic clocks, originally developed for ground-based precision test.)    In some ways, I wish that the book was more technical, with additional details on how GPS works in principle and implementation. Perhaps that's a misguided wish being that a book like this really gives well-deserved attention, and even some glory, to the engineers who made GPS happen; too many technical details can actually obscure our view of the individuals, their determination, and their elation.     Still, there is one thing that I do wish the book had: some photos of the engineers and their early systems and equipment (there must be some out there) and even a few drawings or block diagrams of the GPS system and constellation. After all, those pages of text need some graphic relief and exposition, especially with this topic, which inherently has so many good visuals!     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Bill Schweber writes about all things engineering for EE Times and sister sites EDN and Planet Analog.
