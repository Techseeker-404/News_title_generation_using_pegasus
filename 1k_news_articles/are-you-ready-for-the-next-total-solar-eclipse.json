There are three kinds of solar eclipses: total, partial, and annular (there is also a rare hybrid that starts off as an annular eclipse and then transitions into a total eclipse). In the case of a partial eclipse, the Sun, Earth, and Moon are not perfectly aligned, so the Moon only partially covers the sun.  The Moon\u2019s orbit is elliptical, so it\u2019s distance from the Earth may be greater or smaller from one eclipse to the next. In the case of an annular solar eclipse, the Moon is sufficiently far from the Earth that it appears smaller than the Sun as it passes across the face of the Sun, thereby leaving a bright ring (annulus) of sunlight visible during the eclipse. I was fortunate enough to see a partial solar eclipse a couple of years ago, and it really was very impressive, but the one you really want to see is a total solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon is close enough to the Earth that it completely covers the face of the Sun.  I just read Sun Moon Earth: The History of Solar Eclipses from Omens of Doom to Einstein and Exoplanets by Tyler Nordgren. There are myriad nuggets of knowledge and tidbits of trivia in this tome, but the main thing I got out of it \u2014 driven by Tyler\u2019s contagious enthusiasm \u2014 is the burning desire to see a total solar eclipse for myself. I want to see the phenomena known as \u201cBaily\u2019s beads,\u201d which appear at the very beginning and the very end of totality. These are caused by sunlight streaming through the valleys in the mountain ranges along the edge of the Moon. Once in totality, we see the corona \u2014 an aura of plasma that surrounds the sun and appears as a ring of tendrils that stretch off in all directions.  Described by Tyler as \u201cunimaginably beautiful,\u201d the corona is only ever visible during the few minutes of totality. All of this is accompanied by the air growing colder and birds falling silent. As Tyler says at the end of his prologue to Sun Moon Earth: Make no mistake, the difference between whether you\u2019re inside the path of totality or outside it is literally the difference between day and night. No other experience comes close to the multisensory strangeness of this most unnatural of natural events. From someone who has been there, trust me, the minute it\u2019s over, you\u2019ll wonder where and when to go to see another. Totality changes everything."}
