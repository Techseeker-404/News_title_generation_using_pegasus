Security features in memory aren't new, of course. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cs\u201d in SD card initially stood for \u00e2\u0080\u009csecure,\u201d but the SD Association hasn't really emphasized it for a decade, while electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) has long been used for applications that need embedded security such as credit cards, SIM cards and key-less entry systems, among others. But as different kinds of memory are put into a wider variety of systems\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as automotive, manufacturing and the Internet of Things (IoT) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the need for security has greatly increased. The question is not only where that security will be integrated, but how it will be managed, especially in embedded memories that are expected to remain in a device for years, possibly decades. Jim Handy, principal analyst at Objective Analysis, attended an Intel session at last year's Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) Storage Developer Conference outlining firmware upgrade standards for NVDIMMs and how to address vulnerabilities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrior to that presentation I hadn't considered the numerous places that malware could be inserted into a computing environment,\u201d Handy told EE Times.\u00c2\u00a0 And it's not just an issue for all the places in a system that use flash, he said, such as the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) boot and firmware in SSDs, but also processors within the flash chips to control programming algorithms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the firmware for those processors is stored alongside the data in the flash, creating yet another vulnerability,\u201d Handy said.\u00c2\u00a0 Compromising a particular memory for monetary gain has similar economics to hacking the computers they reside in. Just as Apple computers weren't given a lot attention by viruses and malware because they represented such a small share of the computing market, there are memory technologies that ship so few units there's little return on investment for messing with them. Handy said that given how few SRAM chips are sold per year, it means a whole lot more work on the part of the hackers to find vulnerabilities for a lower payoff. However, if there are billions of a particular DRAM out in the world, there's money to be made with a row hammer attack.

One extreme scenario is stealing a laptop still in sleep mode that's password protected. A thief could use liquid nitrogen on the DRAM modules, remove them and put them into another system to ready the entire contents before they are lost, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe colder you get a DRAM then the longer the bits stay fresh. It doesn't need to be refreshed.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 Self-encrypting drives such as those made by made Virtium include dedicated encryption engines using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) that do not require software to run on the host.  So what about other memories? Like EEPROM, rerroelectric RAM (FRAM) is used in applications already requiring security, such as transit payment cards, said Handy, while magnetic RAM (MRAM) and resistive RAM (RRAM) don't have security hooks yet given that they represent such a small market that compromising them hasn't been worthwhile so far. Flash memory, however, has more security features, he said, particularly NOR flash. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe automotive guys got into security early on because engine controllers use NOR flash, and there were people who had found that they could tune their engines to be less pollution conscious and deliver more power by changing the contents of the NOR,\u201d Handy said. This would cause the engine to break down well before its warranty expired, leaving the automaker on the hook. Today, of course, the ramifications of compromised memory in an automotive system could be far worse than hotrodders tweaking their engines. Today's smart cars and autonomous vehicles are full of sensors, including cameras, radars and lidars transferring mission critical data within the vehicles and outside. Next generation radars, for example, are called cognitive radars with an analog radar controlled by an MCU storing and pull data data in local flash, which has to be authenticated, said Anthony Le, senior director of marketing, ecosystem partnership and North America automotive at Macronix. Otherwise, someone can hack the system and possibly go as far as taking over the vehicle. One of the challenges of layering security into any system is the performance impact. For automotive flash and other memories, the real issue is bootup time, Le said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecurity doesn't add anything in terms of power consumption. The flash consumes very little power compared to MCUs and processors,\u201d he said. Macronix's solutions address the bootup cycle, when the MCU must do a lot of system checks and authentication, which is handled by encryption capabilities on the flash and helps the processor, according to Le. Regardless of memory type, any device be made secure, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just have to put the logic behind it,\u201d he said. NOR Flash is proven in automotive both in terms of cost and quality. But in the next five to 10 years, memory such as RRAM and FRAM will make their way into niche parts of the automotive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in some cases, replacing EEPROM \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it will take time for them to be proven out. In the meantime, Le said NOR flash continues to been Macronix's bread and butter, but NAND flash is seeing growth too. "}
