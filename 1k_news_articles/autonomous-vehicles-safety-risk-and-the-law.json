Autonomous vehicles require innovation and testing in multiple domains \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the sensors, the machine intelligence, the choice of behavior, and, finally, performance of the powertrain, steering, and braking systems to ride safely and comfortably.    While the engineers in us are naturally drawn to the technology, the Day 2 afternoon keynote focused on the unique societal and regulation issues posed by autonomous vehicles. Eric Starkloff, Executive VP of Global Sales and Marketing at NI, led a panel discussion that included three brilliant speakers: Kamal Khouri, VP of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems at NXP Semiconductors, Bryant Walker Smith, Assistant Professor at the School of Law at the University of South Carolina, and Richard Aspinall, Manager of Powertrain Manufacturing at Faraday Future. As an engineer who is intrigued by the public policy alternative implications of technology, I found the discussion fascinating. You can view a video of the discussion, which starts at 10:40.     The observations from Smith, who holds dual degrees in law and engineering, were particularly insightful. He started by challenging widely held perceptions about the law. Many media articles mention states or cities that have passed a law authorizing autonomous vehicles, or something of the like, as if permission is needed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assume that we need a law to do something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smith pointed out that many of the early tests in California were before the state passed an explicit law. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Arizona, home of many of the activities, there has never been a law on automated driving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d        All new technologies solve some previous problems and generate new ones. The massive number of horses required for transportation led to huge manure issues in city streets. Automobiles solved that problem but brought their own pollution problems and accidents. What will be the new issues with autonomous vehicles? Bryant Walker Smith says that they are difficult to predict, but we hope that the sum of new problems is less than the sum of old problems.

Starkloff started the panel discussion by asking about the \u00e2\u0080\u009celephant in the room,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the accident in Phoenix. In this case, an experimental Uber vehicle, driving in autonomous mode with a safety driver in the car, hit and killed a pedestrian. The consensus of the group was that this was a failure of the test design. The driver didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t react and appeared to be reading a book. Uber has stated that some of the car\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaction ability had been detuned. Smith added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should be concerned about automated driving, but we should be terrified of human driving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smith then quoted the U.S. statistics: 100 Americans die in auto accidents every day; 15 of them are pedestrians.     I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not convinced that an attentive driver would have led to another result. Tempe police released the dash video from the accident. The driver had perhaps one second to react to the pedestrian suddenly visible in the headlights. I consider myself a pretty good driver, and I \u00e2\u0080\u009cget into the zone\u00e2\u0080\u009d when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m behind the wheel, focusing my attention on driving. I had a similar experience with a deer on a dark two-lane road in Wisconsin one night. Suddenly, a deer was lit by the headlights. I had perhaps a second, not two, to react. I slammed on the brakes hard, keeping the SUV straight to avoid overturning. Both the deer and the front of my car were destroyed. Would brighter headlights have helped? Not much. We know from basic physics that the light reflected back from headlamps is reduced by the fourth power of the distance, leading to only marginal visibility increases with higher luminosity. This accident scenario is one in which autonomous vehicles, with advanced sensing equipment like LIDAR, should react earlier, better, and more safely.     Smith added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrashes are inevitable, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean a specific crash is inevitable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This led to a discussion of how you test to something that is probabilistic. Smith advocated a database of edge scenarios that would be available to all autonomous car designers. To avoid \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesigning to the test,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smith suggested a rule that any company can use the database as long as they post their results.

In these discussions, we should be aware that the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has released a standard describing six levels of driver autonomy ranging from none to full automation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to know which level we are speaking about in any one situation. The first production car to reach Level 3 has been announced: the 2019 Audi A8.

When asked what is the biggest thing that people get wrong about autonomous driving, Smith answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey think there are driverless cars out there on the road. There are none. These are driver-assistance features.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big difference between getting on a plane and hearing the pilot say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hi folks, I will be using autopilot today\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and hearing the pilot say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hi folks, you will be using autopilot today. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting off.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d    The dream and vision of autonomous vehicles is audacious. Approximately 2.4 million people are injured by auto accidents each year in the U.S., and over 37,000 of those are fatal. Some of these deaths are to those quite young and make a meaningful impact to U.S. life expectancy. Autonomous vehicles aim to take a giant chunk out of those totals. Gasoline- and diesel-based cars are a major source of carbon in our atmosphere. Electric vehicles, combined with renewable energy, aim to make drastic reductions in the carbon footprint. Perhaps the most disruptive long-term effect could be the model of car ownership versus sharing. Along with owning a car comes the issue of parking it. Garages take a significant footprint of new housing. Servicing cars by personally dropping them off is an inconvenient experience. Perhaps there is a new model wherein homes have smaller garages or none at all. Autonomous vehicles act as a customized point-to-point delivery method for mass transportation. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drive or can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drive? No problem.    Indeed, autonomous vehicles have a lot of promise. Much of the conversation about autonomous vehicles rightfully focuses on safety. But what is the right level of safety? While perfect safety is ideal, it is not achievable and certainly not optimal. To the extent that current safety levels are replaced by better safety levels, society benefits. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to bring a replacement technology earlier even if that technology isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perfectly safe. Statistics vary today, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear where we are in that tradeoff. Additionally, while we can have a rational discussion about accident rates and injuries, people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t treat risks solely by their magnitude. Many people have an intense fear of flying, though, statistically, the ride to the airport is often the most dangerous part of their journey. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a perceived lack of control.    We have a future that promises to be safer, cleaner, and more enjoyable. But the raw fact is that there will be accidents, and people will die in those autonomous driving accidents. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tough issue and brings to mind a previous column from EETimes,  Is Robocar Death the Price of Progress?    \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Larry Desjardin is a regular contributor to EDN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Test Cafe.
