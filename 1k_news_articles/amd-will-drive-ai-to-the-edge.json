However, AMD is not yet ready to provide any specifics on the 7-nm x86 and GPU chips that it aims to deliver over the next year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or its roadmap beyond 7 nm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a need for high performance with what we call the edge [of the network] \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 closer to the source where data is coming in and [needing] to be analyzed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often in real time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mark Papermaster, AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief technology officer, in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s machine-learning strategy is holistic and provides engines of AI for both the data center and the edge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Sponsored: Learn about Optimizing power efficiency to bring AI to the end device] In late 2016, AMD released its first GPU accelerators for deep learning in the data center. Since then, Google\u2019s TensorFlow Processing Unit and other designs have shown the advantages of adding arrays of multiply-accumulate units (MACs) in hardware to speed deep-learning algorithms. In May 2017, graphics rival Nidia rolled out Volta, its first GPU with embedded MACs that it called tensor cores. AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CPU rival, Intel, said earlier this year that it plans to move its Movidius accelerator to PC motherboards running Windows ML. Analysts believe that Intel will embed Movidius-inspired cores into its PC processors eventually. Papermaster would not say whether AMD plans to add MAC arrays to the 7-nm Vega GPU that it will launch later this year or the Zen-2 x86 processors that it will release early next year. However, he did say that Vega will support additional formats beyond the 16-bit floating point that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GPUs support today. A lively debate rages over ways to simplify neural networks to speed deep-learning jobs. Arm will support 8-bit operations in its ML Core, Nvidia has done research on 2-bit operations, and Imec is researching a single-bit alternative. "}
