A major focus of this conference was artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, with attendees hearing about the great strides that AI (and software in general) will change the way that we live and work. While we can certainly see that coming, there are many jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even assembly-line jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that are still far too complex for machines. Even so, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing ethical issues that will haunt us.    Ethical issues have arisen not only because of technologies such as AI but from simply having technologies like the internet, mobile phones, and social media. Gideon Lichfield, EiC of MIT Technology Review, opened by talking about ethics of technology. Using a graphic based on tweets that looked into blue and red posts, not just by followers but by content, Lichfield showed just how polarized we are.

We did not see this coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Showing a cover from 2013, Lichfield noted how, at the time, there was a belief that data would save politics. Instead, we have people who seek to discredit data if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like what it shows. The cover also contains a quote that has become more valid today: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mobile phone, the Net, and spread of information \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a deadly combination for dictators.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (I recently visited two former Soviet Bloc countries. People in both spoke of their countries becoming more autocratic.)      In 2013, people believed that big data would save politics. How wrong they were. Source: MIT Technology Review.       Lichfield went on to note how there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a belief in Silicon Valley that we just create technology and stay neutral. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer the case. Why? Because you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t predict how people will use technology. He gave an example of how software can change your face in a video or change your voice to the point at which you can pass for someone else. MIT Technology Review editor Will Knight used freely available software to superimpose Ted Cruz\u2019s face onto actor Paul Rudd in a video. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer OK to just create technology. We need to regulate tech for a better society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     AI has the potential to change society, but it has a long way to go, noted MIT professor Josh Tenenbaum, whose team of researchers is looking for way to make machines learn in a way that mimics the way that humans learn.    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do we have all of these AI algorithms but essentially no AI?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. According to Tenenbaum, machines still lack the learning ability and common sense of humans. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlgorithms are not even close to the intelligence of even a one-year-old.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So far, the machines in use today, especially in factories, were designed to do just one thing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 say, welding \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that they can do with better accuracy and repeatability than can people, but the robots do only that one thing. Tenenbaum wants to understand why humans can do so much more than machines. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI technologies are driven by pattern recognition and deep learning. Intelligence is so much more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d       MIT professor Josh Tenenbaum explains how cognitive science becomes artificial intelligence. Photo by Martin Rowe.       Tenenbaum and his students are trying to reverse-engineer the ways that people think and solve problems, then apply that to machines. He reports some exciting progress, saying that we have a long way to go even though the math of deep learning was published in the 1960s to 1980s in psychology journals.     Tenenbaum also noted Alan Turing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famous 1950 paper, which pointed out that children are the only thing we know of that grows into human life intelligence. Turing assumed that a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain is like a blank sheet of paper, but Tenenbaum said that Turing was wrong. For example, Prof. Rebecca Saxe has shown that we are born with the wiring for intelligence and learning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe understand people, places, and things, not just patterns and pixels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Prof. Laura Schulz studies how children learn by thinking. Tenenbaum looks to their research to model how we learn and apply it to machines.    Tenenbaum then showed two videos of young children solving problems that machines can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t currently do. In one, a toddler can stack rings in order by size. In another video, an adult tried to put books in a closet while the closet door was closed. Another toddler could figure out that the doors needed to be open and opened them.    Another conference talk given by Veobot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Clara Vu echoed Tenenbaum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that \u00e2\u0080\u009chumans are amazing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vu explained the process involved when someone applies mascara. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too complicated for today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s machines. Vu did, however, show how industrial robots can do things that people can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do. She contrasted tasks in an automobile factory, where robots are much better at welding than people but final assembly is still done by people, noting how both GM and Tesla failed to automate final assembly because it involves many tasks and there are many car models with differences.    Vu noted how automating a single process requires a team of engineers working for months or years and that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a large investment. If you change anything in the process, you have to reprogram the machines. People are much better at adapting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRobots can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assemble a cable harness. With manufacturers being pushed to have varied products, we need a new flexible automation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d      Clara Vu of Veobot described how we need perception and actuation to perform a task. Photo by Martin Rowe.       \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat makes industrial robots so strong also makes them dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Vu. She explained how robots must be kept in cages to keep people safe. Her company is developing algorithms that use sensors to detect the presence of people near the robot. If the person gets too close, the robot ceases operation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe built the systems to be fail-safe. We analyze the entire space. If we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guarantee that a space isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occupied, we assume that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s occupied.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While this function doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require machine learning, it does show how people can work alongside robots. Vu described this as \u00e2\u0080\u009cold-fashioned AI.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    Vu explained that robotics includes actuation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRobots have to do something. While actuation is simple, perception is hard. We are still decades or centuries away from machines performing some human actuation. We have to solve many problems before we can make a flexible factory like we can with humans. Robots can make cable harnesses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    While Tenenbaum and Vu see situations in which robots still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compete with people, Ganesh Bell, founder of Uptake, claimed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery business will be reimagined with software. AI will process data taken by IoT devices. AI and predictive analytics is the next productivity boost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company produces software that can be used for predictive analytics. But he noted that people still have to act on those predictions to prevent unwanted disruptions in machine operations.      Ganesh Bell said that AI will change the way that people work, but people still have to act upon AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendations.
