The funding, part of a $51.95 million program for CZI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Neurodegeneration Challenge Network, aims to bring together experimental scientists from diverse biomedical research fields, as well as computational biologists and physicians to understand the underlying causes of neurodegenerative disorders. The Belgian team is led by professor Patrik Verstreken (VIB-KU Leuven), alongside clinical expert professor Wim Vandenberghe (UZ Leuven) and neuro-engineer Dr. Dries Braeken (imec). Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Huntington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, and ALS, are a class of diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. The causes of most of the diseases are only partly understood, and there are still no effective therapies to cure, prevent, or even treat most of these disorders. Alzheimer's disease alone is the fifth most common cause of death for Americans above age 65, and the number of people with Alzheimer's and related dementias is predicted to nearly triple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from 5 million people to 14 million people \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by 2060. The Belgian team plans to create a new chip to study the mechanisms of Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will produce mature human neuronal microcircuits that are relevant to Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease on a multi-electrode array chip,\u201d saidimec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Braeken said. \u201cThis chip will be used to measure electrophysiological changes between neuronal circuits of cells obtained from healthy people and from an extensive collection of Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The 2D chip is a first step to develop a 3D human-relevant model for brain function and disease. Verstreken said the goal is to \u201cprint\u201d tiny portions of the human brain on a unique chip, giving researchers access to human brain tissue, from both patients and healthy individuals. They will use the technology not only to track disease progression, but also to screen for strategies to correct problems. Meanwhile, Vandenberghe, said the potential benefits expand far beyond the field of Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we will develop this chip using tissue from Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patients, the same technology can be used to create better models for Huntington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, or any other neurodegenerative disease for that matter,\u201d Vandenberghe said. The foundation selected nine project teams from a competitive international call. Next to the Belgian consortium, only one other non-US team was selected. CZI said that despite tremendous investment and progress in understanding neurodegenerative diseases, there remains a surprising amount of very basic information about their biology that is not known. The initiative is hoping to inspire a new approach to tackling neurodegenerative disease, supporting interdisciplinary collaborations and generating shared tools, resources and platforms.
