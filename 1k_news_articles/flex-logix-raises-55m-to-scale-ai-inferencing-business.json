This round, led by Mithril Capital Management plus existing investors Lux Capital, Eclipse Ventures and the Tate Family Trust, takes the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total funding since being founded in 2014 to $82 million. Geoff Tate In an interview with EE Times, Geoff Tate, CEO and co-founder of Flex Logix, said that while the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original eFPGA business was already a commercial success, the investment would help grow its inferencing business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur inferencing chip, InferX X1 is sampling to customers at the moment. The funding will enable us to ramp up production of this chip and build a new sales team to focus on this side of the business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said the company plans to hire some 50 people over the next nine months, doubling in size from its current 50 staff. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur eFPGA business is already cash positive. Our initial engagement in the early years was government, particularly DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). That got us lots of projects, and also commercial customers, such as Dialog Semiconductor for their configurable power management ICs (PMICs),\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tate. Dialog licensed Flex Logix\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eFPGA and its compiler at the end of 2019, to enable configurability of Dialog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future PMICs. Flex Logix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inference architecture is optimized for low latency operation required by edge megapixel vision applications. It combines numerous 1-dimensional tensor processors with reconfigurable, high bandwidth, non-blocking interconnect that enables each layer of the neural network model to be configured for maximum utilization, resulting in very high performance at lower cost and power. The connections between compute and memory are reconfigured in millionths of a second as the model is processed. This architecture is the basis of Flex Logix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s InferX X1 edge inference accelerator which is now running YOLOv3 object detection and sampling to lead customers. Tate said this programmable interconnect architecture evolved from the eFPGA architecture, explaining the background. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust over 2 years ago a customer was asking for a suggestion on how to implement inferencing on FPGA. My co-founder came up with a new architecture, InferX. In many FPGAs, 80% of it is used for programmable interconnect, not programmable logic. That same programmable interconnect is used for inferencing, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-blocking, which addresses customer needs to address latency issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Earlier this month, Flex Logic said it expanded its license agreement with DARPA for its EFLX eFPGA technology. The agreement allows DARPA researchers to maintain all the benefits of hard-wired circuitry, while also adding the capability to change the circuit after tape-out if they need to modify, update or fix a functional bug in their algorithm or accelerator.\u00c2\u00a0 Tate said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince partnering with DARPA in 2017, Flex Logix has provided its eFPGA to many U.S. government funded programs which need the flexibility and reprogrammability of eFPGA in chips at more advanced nodes. Because researchers often only get funding to tape-out a chip once, it makes strategic sense to also include EFLX and the EFLX Compiler to the Toolbox Initiative in support of DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research programs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The latest investment is led by Mithril Capital, who recently also led the series B investment in Nuvia (which was recently acquired by Qualcomm for $1.4 billion). Mithril\u00e2\u0080\u0099s managing general partner and founder, Ajay Royan, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are impressed with the very high inference-throughput/$ architecture that Flex Logix has developed based on unique intellectual property. This technology advantage positions Flex Logix for rapid growth in edge enterprise inference in applications such as medical, retail, industrial, robotics and more. It is even more impressive that they have done this with so little capital and at the same time built a cash-flow positive eFPGA business with large growth potential as SoC designers look to incorporate reconfigurability into their communications and data center ICs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tate said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMithril\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong support, combined with the continued backing from our existing investors, will allow us to further build out our software, engineering and customer support teams and accelerate the availability of our hardware and software for edge enterprise applications. Our InferX X1 chips and boards will be available for mass production in mid-2021 along with availability of our InferX Inference compiler, which takes in Tensorflow Lite and ONNX neural network models and generates the code to run InferX X1 without the detailed programming other solutions require.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Investors are indeed relying on Tate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track record. From managing AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s microprocessor and logic group with over 500 people to leading his first startup, Rambus, from four people and $2 million in equity to a NASDAQ IPO and multi-billion dollar market cap. Peter Hebert, co-founder and managing Partner of Lux Capital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all have confidence Geoff can do it again, building Flex Logix into an industry-defining, stand-alone public company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So now with the series D, is there an IPO on the cards next, we asked Tate? His response: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plan is to go public. But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know when, it could be a few years out yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
