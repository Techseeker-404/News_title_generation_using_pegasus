(YMTC) and NOR flash designed by GigaDevice, China has had more ambition than results. Creating DRAM would be a big step in validating China's semiconductor ambitions, but industry opinion has been split on whether China can deliver DRAM at all. Even if it does, observers ask how soon China can start shipping commercial DRAMs in meaningful volume. ChangXin claims to be already doing it. Surprise. ChangXin Memory thusfar completed the R&D and Fab 1. (Source: ChangXin Memory)  In an exclusive interview with EE Times , representatives of ChangXin Memory (formerly known as Innotron Memory) said the company has completed its Fab 1 and R&D facility in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province, and is currently running 20,000 wafers per month. It is scheduled to double its capacity to 40,000 wafers per month in the second quarter of 2020. Using a 19-nm process technology, ChangXin has begun producing this fall LPDDR4, DDR4 8Gbit DRAM products. Instead of pursuing the commodity DRAM market, ChangXin has chosen to go after the production of mainstream DRAM. ChangXin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emergence as a viable DRAM producer in China is noteworthy, given that several indigenous DRAM vendors have seen their business either stall or die. Worse, Tsinghua Unigroup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original plans for DRAM production in Nanjing and Chengdu, for example, ended up getting exploited to jack up land prices. Separating ChangXin from China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other DRAM production attempts is the fact that ChangXin isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just talking the talk. It has actually built a fab, (with expansion plans for two more), while simultaneously building infrastructure to house as many as 3,000 employees and their families in Hefei. Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behind ChangXin?  ChangXin is run by Yiming Zhu, GigaDevice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former president. It was founded in 2016 by Hefei Industrial Investment Fund and GigaDevice. Technically speaking, the company has no DRAM heritage. ChangXin also has no association with the Tsinghua Unigroup. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entry into the DRAM market has been tough so far largely for two reasons. First, China has little production experience or expertise. Second, China has not accumulated DRAM-related IP of its own. So, how does ChangXin getting around such foundational challenges? Of the 3,000 employees at ChangXin, 70 percent are engineers and technical staff, explained Ian Ng, director of business development at ChangXin. ChangXin acknowledged that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been recruiting engineers from Korea and Taiwan to build its fundamental DRAM knowledge. It has also hired technical staff formerly at Qimonda. These recruits include Karl Heinz Kuesters, who signed on as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsultant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ChangXin views Kuesters as ChangXin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DRAM ace in the hole. He worked at Qimonda/Infineon for 24 years until Nov. 2008. Kusters was vice president of technology and predevelopment at Qimonda. Qimonda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bailiwick was \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrench capacitor\u00e2\u0080\u009d process technology, now regarded as an outdated DRAM technology. When the industry learned that ChangXin was hiring ex-Qimonda people, the assumption followed that ChangXin was using Qimonda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old trench technology. ChangXin revealed, however, that it has moved into production using \u201cstack capacitor\u201d process technology. It turns out that Kuesters was responsible for developing Qimonda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own stack capacitor process technology while he was still there. Qimonda, however, ran out of money before it could transition to stack capacitor. ChangXin Memory is using \u201cstack capacitor\u201d process technology, instead of \u201ctrench capacitor\u201d technology.

Once viewed as the Chinese DRAM maker with a knack for ramping up yield, Fujian Jinhua today is deemed pretty much \u00e2\u0080\u009cdead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fujian Jinhua faced a double whammy, first being accused of stealing trade secrets from Micron, then being put on the entity \u00e2\u0080\u009cblacklist\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the U.S. government. One memory industry observer based in Silicon Valley, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe operational architecture [of Fujian Jinhua] was pretty smart: Recruit in Taiwan DRAM engineers who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to live in China and then only ship production technology to Jinhua.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only problem is that it recruited too many Micron-Nanya people and some were accused of taking trade-secrets with them.\u00c2\u00a0It also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that Taiwan is critically dependent on the U.S. for military and political support. So even before the Trump administration, the Taiwan government had complied with a U.S. order to shut down Jinhua Taiwan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The nail in the coffin was the U.S. sanctions. The case, under which the U.S. Commerce Department last year practically banned all exports and technology transfers to Fujian Jinhua, is one of the clearest outcomes yet of Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s war on the rise of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tech sector. Sanctions by the U.S. and by extension by Taiwan, exacerbated Fujian Jinhua\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shortage of the imported materials to keeping fabrication going. The first factor in Fujian Jinhua\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premature burial was its handling of trade secrets.\u00c2\u00a0ChangXin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liu stressed that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cvitally important to put a strict proper process in place within a company\u00e2\u0080\u009d so that the outcome of the technology developed at the company can be proven uncontaminated by trade secrets imported by employees who had worked elsewhere.
