Flexible sensors are thus becoming increasingly attractive for benefits including the printing of multiple arrays, cost efficiencies, thinner profiles, light weight and conformability. Individual sensors deliver individual data points, which are not sufficient in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Demand is rising for data-intensive applications that use AI, but solutions based on individual sensors cannot deliver reliable data in the volumes needed for comprehensive and actionable information. Many applications that call themselves AI-based are in fact limited by the degree of artificial intelligence they integrate. For example, digital web-connected thermostats do use AI, but because they are only pulling data from one internal source, external conditions can cause them to register false readings. For manufacturing, AI can create positive impacts on yields and lessen production risks if the right kinds of sensor systems are deployed. Sensor systems built from PE arrays are a better approach for collecting wide sets of data. More sensors and more data points can enable true AI, not a mere succession of \u00e2\u0080\u009cif\u00e2\u0080\u009d statements. Materials design is a vital component of printed sensor systems. It is important to design sensors with the best materials for the fastest and most accurate reactions, which are essential to achieving rapid and reliable data capture, enabling accurate use of AI. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about speed. Agricultural and industrial technology are burgeoning markets for sensor arrays due to the variety of data they can gather in volume. For example, a lightweight, conformable sensor system installed to monitor a pump in a factory could take tens of thousands of measurements per second. The resut could create a unique fingerprint of the pump that can show not only how well a device is working, but also data about the material passing through it. Environmental sensors are another area where it is easy to see the difference some expertise in materials science can make. For example, contaminants that are important to detect in drinking water may not need to be detected in lake water. Sensor design\u00e2\u0080\u0094starting with materials\u00e2\u0080\u0094is critical to filter out what is considered noise and what is considered a meaningful signal. Since AI is only as useful as the information fed to it, each type of sensor may require its own materials for substrates, inks and protective layers. Performance must be optimized via material design in order to ensure the sensor can meet a manufacturer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system specifications. \u2013Dan Brewer is executive director of emerging technologies advancement at Brewer Science, a company he joined in 1996.
