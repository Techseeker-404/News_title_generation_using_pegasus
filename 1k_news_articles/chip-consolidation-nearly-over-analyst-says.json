The industry has been in a slow-growth rut for quite a long time, he added. Those doldrums may be past as the outlook is for overall industry revenue to soar to $400 billion this year from $339.7 billion in 2016, and consolidation starts to pay off, Wiseman said. For the first time in years, semiconductor prices are increasing, and that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just mean memory chips, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause of consolidation, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing rising prices for mature products,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Wiseman. One measure of the health of the industry is the R&D cost-to-revenue ratio, which even after the recent buying spree remains very stable at around 14 to 15 percent. If it gets to 17 percent, chip suppliers need to raise prices, \u201cand this is an industry that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like that \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a memory provider,\u201d Wiseman quipped. Other factors also augur an end to the acquisition binge. There have been a lot of regulatory approval holdups, especially for those coming out of China, he said just a day before U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor by an investment fund backed by the Chinese government. Prior to leaving office in January, former U.S. President Barack Obama released a report warning that China\u2019s ambitious push to expand its domestic chip production could threaten the U.S. semiconductor industry. Based on McKinsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prediction, any further attempts by China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tsinghua Group or other government-funded entities to buy U.S. chipmakers are likely to be thwarted. If that happens, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aim to become a major player in the global chip industry may also hit a speed bump. Now may be a time for the acquirers in the chip industry to sit back and digest the companies they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gobbled up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of the companies that felt confident to make acquisitions are busy integrating the companies they bought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wiseman, who has advised chipmakers around the globe on business strategy.  Deals Still on the Table Some deals still on the table may spell the end for the industry M&A activity, based on the McKinsey outlook. Toshiba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lucrative NAND flash memory business remains a hotly pursued quarry for several groups led by Bain Capital, Western Digital and Foxconn. Apple continues to be an active player in the bidding, according to Bloomberg. Apple depends on flash memory from Toshiba in its iPhones and iPods, and wants a secure supply to limit its dependence on rival Samsung Electronics, which also supplies OLED screens for the latest iPhones and is Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main rival in the smartphone business. The number of memory suppliers has collapsed from 32 DRAM companies decades ago to just three today: Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron. On the NAND side, there are four major IP holders: a joint venture between Micron and Intel; another alliance between Toshiba and Western Digital; Samsung; and SK Hynix. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to acquire NXP for a price of $110 a share, or a total of $38 billion in cash. The largest maker of mobile phone chips has extended its tender offer for NXP to Sept. 22, the eighth postponement since the deal was announced in November. European regulators have raised questions on the deal, while NXP shareholders such as Elliot Management have been saying the Qualcomm offer for NXP isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attractive enough. Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs said he believes the offer is a fair price. Mark your calendars. September may be the month when the dust settles on the M&A activity and the big players remaining in the chip industry can look forward to strong sales and better profitability. Not everyone in the electronics ecosystem may be happy about that. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times.
