The lesson of Google continues to ripple through all businesses seeking competitive insights from their data pools, however large or small. Today, the Internet of Things is opening vast new data sources, expanding big data\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise to reshape business, technology, and the job of the technologist. Along the way, big data is inspiring new kinds of processor and systems architectures, as well as evolving algorithms and programming techniques. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe concept of being overwhelmed by data is the new normal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Anthony Scriffignano, chief data scientist of Dun & Bradstreet, at a recent event hosted by the Churchill Club. Inderpal Bhandari, the first chief data officer of IBM, also spoke at the event. The goal of the new role is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cchange major processes an enterprise has so that their outcomes are better, so faster and better decisions get made,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bhandari. Some of the largest recent IPOs in tech are being fueled by big data. They include Cloudera and Hortonworks, who helped drive Hadoop, an open-source equivalent of Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core MapReduce algorithm. At Stanford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Data Science Initiative, researchers are working the big-data techniques in the hands of the average company.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMachine learning is impressive but really hard to use. Even the most sophisticated companies might only have a couple of people that can apply those techniques optimally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stephen Eglash, executive director of the initiative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can imagine the day when these tools are available in the equivalent of Microsoft Office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To get there, Stanford researchers are developing Snorkel, a tool to automate the process of labeling and ingesting big data sets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far enough along that you can see that it will work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Eglash. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want the domain experts to use these techniques without needing a computer science expert.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The IEEE Big Data Initiative is taking a different approach, making large data sets freely available for research through its Dataport service. So far, they include examples as diverse as real-time feeds of New York City traffic and neuron movements in a human brain. Commercial big data projects are just as diverse, says Wayne Thompson, chief data scientist at SAS, a data analytics pioneer founded in 1976. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are working with a semiconductor company to help reduce defects in their chip fab process through improved computer vision. One of our development partners is applying deep learning to help improve soccer players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performance. We also are applying deep learning to monitor and count endangered wildlife through footprint image analysis and tracking/\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smaller companies are getting traction, too. Although it has just 150 people, Real-Time Innovations Inc. (RTI) claims more than 1,000 design wins for its novel databus software for real-time monitoring. It uses a subscribe-and-publish model for tracking nodes, typically on sensor networks. One of its first big users was a middleware server installed in the U.S.S. Cole after it was bombed in the Middle East. The software is also used in many hydroelectric plants, including Grand Coulee Dam, hospital instruments built by GE Healthcare, and wind turbine farms operated by Siemens. The company recently named former Sun Microsystems co-founder, Scott McNealy, to an advisory board that will help it scale. RTI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the next evolution of what we used to describe as \u00e2\u0080\u0098the network is the computer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said McNealy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, the network is also the power grid and a lot of other things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Next page: Data scientists in high demand     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
