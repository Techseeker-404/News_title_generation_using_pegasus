They range from explorations of the molecular physics behind advanced CMOS to the latest debates in technology policy. As Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation went into effect, Imec researchers demoed radar as an alternative to surveillance cameras to provide data while protecting identity. The systems, aimed at use in smart buildings, sensed and tracked moving robots and humans, including vital signs such as breathing and heart rate. Unlike most cameras, radar operates in the dark, provides 3D image data, and more easily blends into surroundings. However, radar sports higher costs due in part to its lower volumes. Demos showed 7- and 77-GHz radars tracking the movements of robots using various machine-learning algorithms. So far, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear which frequencies are best-suited to radar for smart buildings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a wilderness of options, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much regulation or standardization giving direction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also the markets are still emerging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Katherine Philips, director of IoT at Imec. Radar signals can detect heartbeat and respiration, although not at medical-grade accuracy. (All images provided by Imec unless otherwise noted.)   Imec described a new program exploring III-V processes and new circuit designs to build faster, more efficient RF components that are still CMOS-compatible. The technology aims to serve a wide range of applications from 5G cellular to terahertz imaging. The effort is in part motivated by a need for smaller cellular front-end modules that support a growing range of frequency bands. It also aims to decrease the growing number of antennas needed in phased arrays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe number of switches, power amps, and filters needed for cellular systems seems to nearly double each generation, and now 5G is adding millimeter-wave support,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nadine Collaert, manager of the high-speed analog RF program. The project recognizes that CMOS can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep up with required speeds, but III-V processes hold great promise. For instance, gallium nitride \u00e2\u0080\u009cis used in base stations, and we believe that it will be extremely important for [mmWave] small cells and maybe even handsets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. The program seeks ways to integrate more exotic processes and designs with CMOS. It will explore techniques such as use of hybrid 3D circuit stacks. So far, Imec recruited a mix of four foundry and fabless partners for the program. It believes that it will have spinoff benefits in areas including high-speed wired networking, imaging, and cellular backhaul beyond 60 GHz. A separate effort at an Imec lab in Osceola County, Florida, has developed a prototype of a tunable 0- to 1.3-THz imaging system. It aims to slash by more than half the cost of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laser-based scanners for uses that include inspecting everything from consumer packages to rebar in nuclear power plants. To meet tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s required speeds, RF components need to move up to III-V materials yet remain compatible with CMOS.   The expected acceleration of the market for electric cars is driving interest in denser, safer batteries. Imec is working with partners to adopt silicon as an anode replacing graphite in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lithium-ion batteries, delivering a 50% density improvement. Lithium-ion is expected to reach its limits with the silicon anode. The next big leap is in using lithium metal eventually in a solid-state battery. Given the research hurdles ahead, such batteries could still be more than a decade away. Materials engineers are working on new kinds of functional coatings between anode and cathode materials as one key to the effort. The coatings act as an ion-to-electron interface, extending density and speeding charge times.
