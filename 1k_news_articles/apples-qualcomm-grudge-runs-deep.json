I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about legal fees here. I wonder if Apple, the behemoth of the global smartphone market, feels entitled to put both iPhone users and cellular carriers at a disadvantage. Apple could do this by \u00e2\u0080\u009cdetuning\u00e2\u0080\u009d the performance of Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s modem chips, or it could simply dump Qualcomm altogether in favor of modem chips with lesser features and lower performance from Qualcomm competitors.  Is Apple pulling all these maneuvers to win the legal fight at all costs? Does Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grudge against Qualcomm run so deep? Or is Apple bluffing, in an attempt to weaken Qualcomm that has dominated the smartphone chip market for too long?   The industry is abuzz with speculation that Apple might disdain Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2018-model modem chips.  Legal disputes between Apple and Qualcomm over Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s licensing practices are well known. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been dragging out seemingly forever, with none anywhere close to resolution.  Since Apple already sources non-Qualcomm chips from Intel, starting with iPhone 7 and 7-plus last year and continuing into the iPhone 8 family, investors are entertaining the possibility that a new iPhone scheduled for launch next year could ditch Qualcomm entirely, in favor of chips from Intel, possibly MediaTek.  Technology analysts, however, believe such an action could put Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future iPhone users at a disadvantage. After all, not all modem chips are created equal.  Jim McGregor, founder and principal analyst at Tirias Research, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe anyone would consider Intel and MediaTek on par with Qualcomm. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cQualcomm holds an 18 to 24-month lead in wireless technology, similar to what Intel used to have in terms of process technology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0  The issue that separates Qualcomm from Intel in modem chips is CDMA support. McGregor noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntel has not fielded a modem with CDMA yet (CDMA is used by Verizon and Sprint in the United Staets), but has indicated that one is coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, however, that MediaTek does have a modem supporting CDMA.  Further, there will be far-reaching ramifications for future iPhones if Apple parts ways with Qualcomm. McGregor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth Intel and MediaTek are still lagging behind Qualcomm in future technologies like gigabit LTE and 5G, because it\u2019s Qualcomm\u2019s R&D and subsequent IP that helps define these standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  In his view, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if Apple switches away from Qualcomm chips, Apple will still end up paying royalties for the IP.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Significantly, Apple has already gone out of its way to create an artificial parity between iPhones based on Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s modem chips and those with Intel chips. McGregor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple has already been detuning the Qualcomm modems to ensure the difference in performance between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is not visible to consumers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Indeed, in a court document filed by Qualcomm earlier this year in the Apple vs Qualcomm case, Qualcomm wrote as follows: Apple chose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7 (preventing consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovation); and then, when the Qualcomm-based iPhones still outperformed the Intel-based iPhones, Apple (i) falsely claimed that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno discernible difference\u00e2\u0080\u009d between iPhones with Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chipsets and iPhones with Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chipsets, and (ii) acted to prevent Qualcomm from revealing to consumers the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chipsets.  Apple has withheld approximately XXXX [redacted] owed to Qualcomm under a contract relating to a high-speed feature of Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chipset. McGregor predicts, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat delta [between iPhones with Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s modem and those with others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 modem] will grow with new technologies, as the current and future releases add support for higher speeds and other wireless technologies like mmWave, which Intel and MediaTek may not be able to support at the same time as Qualcomm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  McGregor wonders if Apple could end up with new iPhones that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay be a generation behind in modem technology to Android phones that sell for a half to the third of the cost of the iPhone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNote that this also impacts carriers, because the newer technologies improve spectrum efficiency and network efficiency while reducing the cost per bit to transmit data.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0  Getting a design win in Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iPhones is a huge deal for any chip vendors. But history shows little Apple loyalty to its chip suppliers who, once dumped, face a drop in stock prices that might well be fatal.  McGregor observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple does hold a grudge. Qualcomm wouldn\u2019t be the first supplier Apple has tried to trounce \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just think of Samsung and Imagination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it likely won\u2019t be the last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times  Related story: Apple vs Qualcomm: Who Extorted Whom?
