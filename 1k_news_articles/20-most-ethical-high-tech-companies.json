In light of that reality, more and more organizations are putting time and energy into perfecting their compliance and ethics practices and procedures. Especially in the electronics and high-technology sectors, there are some excellent examples of organizations that have built stellar reputations and have built their business as a result. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the last 12 years, we have repeatedly seen that those companies who focus on transparency and authenticity are rewarded with the trust of employees, customers, and investors. While negative headlines might grab attention, the companies who support the rule of law and operate with decency and fair play around the globe will always succeed in the long term,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Timothy Erblich, CEO of the Ethisphere Institute said in a written statement.
