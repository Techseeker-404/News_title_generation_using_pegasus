{"Author": "Bill Schweber\u00a0", "Date": "03.08.2021", "Keywords": "Power", "Article": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always impressed at how much technology and manufacturing expertise is embedded in the apparently simple products we take for granted and about which we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give much thought. Consider the AC line-cord plug, which most of us use \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even abuse, by yanking on the cord itself rather than the plug body \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without much thinking. It does one thing, usually does it well and safely, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause problems except in rare cases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even then, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as likely that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the socket and not the plug that is to blame. I realized this again when I saw an advertisement from Interpower Corp., a company that understands and makes these cords in countless versions, configurations, and varieties (I do like no-nonsense, informative ads rather than image-based ads). While I knew that there were different plug styles for various countries or global regions, that seemed to be a minor problem. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re traveling, you bring adapters; if you are shipping systems, you provide the appropriate cord for the end-user. Either way, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a manageable issue. But one of the ads pointed out the very subtle difference between plugs used in North America and the plug for Japan, Figure 1. You can sort of use one in place of the other, but there are some critical differences that may result in short- and long-term reliability issues.\u00c2\u00a0 Fig 1: This no-nonsense advertisement highlighted the subtle difference between a North American AC plug and one specified for use in Japan. (Image source: Interpower/author) It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a matter of meeting the technical standards. The second ad I saw showed the eight cord orientations available for a\u00c2\u00a0 standard flat-plug cord to better fit the available space at the outlet or between adjacent outlets, Figure 2. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those things you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about much until you see it, and then realize how handy it can be in some settings. Fig 2: Even the basic flat plug and power cable is available in eight orientations to meet unique space and real-estate constraints. (Image source: Interpower/author) Thus far, these differences seem fairly modest, with just some re-dimensioning of the contact blades or re-arrangement of the wiring arrangement and body molding. But then I spent some time at the Interpower site and learned some more about the intricacies of AC plugs. Sure, they have to meet various UL standards in the U.S. and comparable ones elsewhere \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious. But a plug for general-purpose use is quite different in internal design and construction than one which is rated as \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital grade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even though the voltage and current ratings are the same. Reference 1 explains this in accordance with power supply cord standards UL 817 and C22.2 No. 21-14, including this: \u00e2\u0080\u009c(1) the blades must be solid instead of folded brass, (2) the blades are usually nickel-plated, (3) the plug includes an internal cable retention device or strain relief to prevent any stress to the plug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal connections, and (4) NEMA plug and receptacle are marked \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hospital-grade\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and with a green dot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Interpower notes that its retention device uses three stainless steel rings to solidly hold the connections in place, Figure 3. The site also discusses the obvious and subtle differences in standards and tests for hospital-grade cords in various countries. Fig 3: Among other differences, a hospital-grade AC cord has internal cable-retention as part of the design and fabrication, while a standard molded cord likely has none. (Image source: Interpower) Another difference between regular and hospital grade is the regulatory test which simulates someone jerking a cord to unplug it. In the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbrupt Pull Test\u00e2\u0080\u009d for hospital-grade cords, a 10-pound weight is attached and then dropped, repeatedly, while for consumer cords the weight is just 2 \u00c2\u00bd pounds (see a video, Reference 2). Even the ubiquitous power strip has many vagaries. Formally known as a \u00e2\u0080\u009csocket strip\u00e2\u0080\u009d among its other names (UL 1363 refers to them as a relocatable power tap or RPT; other names include power strips, power bars in Canada, power distribution units, and power boards in Australia) it gets considerable attention and exposition in Reference 3. There are also explanations of the different mounting arrangements (table-top versus rack) and circuit breaker/fusing mandates, along with the many country-by-country differences. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never look at a power strip as a <$10 \u00e2\u0080\u009cno big deal\u00e2\u0080\u009d item, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for sure.\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough time in a designer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life to become fully knowledgeable about every component in a system or product under development. However, there are many times when the details and relevant standards can affect what you ship and where. It certainly doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt to check out various websites and application information from knowledgeable specialists, including component vendors.\u00c2\u00a0 Have you ever been involved in a major product hold-up due to failure to understand or meet a basic standard? How about other regulatory requirements such as for RFI/EMI, or wireless bands and allowed modulation? What about differences between various countries and regions? Have you ever been told (or said) \u00e2\u0080\u009chey, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a simple XYZ\u00e2\u0080\u009d only to find out there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no such thing as \u00e2\u0080\u009csimple\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the world of technology, even for mundane components?
