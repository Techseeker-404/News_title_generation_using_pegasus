Amid the hubbub of officers chasing patrons out, an employee presents the prefect with his winnings from the night. So this darling of social networking is now getting pilloried in the business press and sold short on Wall Street. No doubt the savvy traders who made money on its rise are taking a cut on its current stumble. Engineers have seen from the get-go that every click on free web services from Amazon to Zoom is being saved, shared, sold, and analyzed. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one reason why most comments in the discussion threads below our stories at EE Times come from anonymous readers using pseudonyms. For what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, we genuinely hold our share of laudable intentions. We want to connect readers with the exact information they need just when they need it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if only they would tell us everything about themselves. The freewheeling economy has plenty of room for motives in every shade of white, black, and gray. So we may see more attempts to define traffic signs for e-commerce. For example, I imagine a big red warning next to all of those very convenient offers to log on to a new web service using your Facebook or Google+ credentials. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so easy to get lulled into big-data denial. But what gets pushed down pops up again \u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually somewhere else. I have no idea what the bottom will be in Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current stock dive. But my belief is that it will, at most, serve to cool its superheated engines. Just last week, Facebook engineers revealed that they had to lash together network switches with a snake pit of cables to keep up with their heady traffic growth last year. To keep pace with their forecasts, they said that they need within three years optical interfaces on network chips, bridging an opto-electrical chasm that engineers have avoided for decades. My bet is on a short-lived #DeleteFacebook movement followed by another long binge of social networking. Given the nascent state of neural-network-powered analytics, this roller coaster has many more ups and downs ahead and they will only get steeper. The free services and the ad dollars are not only sticky, they are downright addictive. From reports I see on the internet, Rick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Caf\u00c3\u00a9 is still doing a brisk business. "}
