He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to find a replacement for Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, but he does hope to \u00e2\u0080\u009cshake things up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d creating a handful of alternatives for advancing semiconductor performance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think exponential growth on a single variable [such as CMOS scaling] is achievable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chappell said in an interview about the Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI). \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe next era we\u2019re heading into is about progress in lots of variables\u00e2\u0080\u00a6hardware/software co-design, new materials and functional blocks, specialization for each app\u00e2\u0080\u00a6We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not out of ideas at all, this is a wildly interesting time where lots of creativity will make up for the march of scaling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chappell, director of the microsystems group at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  Many industry executives heard about ERI for the first time at a June meeting Chappell hosted in Austin during the Design Automation Conference. About 60 people attended the meeting from companies including Analog Devices, ARM, Cadence, IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, Synopsys, TSMC and Xilinx. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was an intro to the program for industry leaders who may not have been involved with DARPA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Steve Keckler, a vice president of architecture research at Nvidia, who spoke at the event about the GPU designer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work with the agency. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see ERI as an opportunity to engage a broader set of partners to bring things to market, many who haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t collaborated with DARPA before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Keckler said. This week DARPA conducted a two-day meeting in San Jose to work with chip experts and help them form partnerships. As many as 300 people attended, representing about 45 companies, 10 defense contractors and numerous universities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the start of something with teeth behind it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chappell said during a break in the event. Earlier, DARPA hosted a meeting with defense contractors in Washington D.C. to spawn their ideas. A team of ERI program managers will package the best concepts into a formal call for proposals in September. DARPA will pick and negotiate contracts on winning projects over the following seven months before funding is released and the hard work begins.
