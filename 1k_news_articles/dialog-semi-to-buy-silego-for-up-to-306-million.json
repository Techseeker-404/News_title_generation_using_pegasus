Dialog executives described Silego\u2019s technology as highly complementary to Dialog\u2019s own power management and connectivity offerings. They estimated the deal would expand Dialog\u2019s total addressable market by more than $1.4 billion. Silego\u2019s CMICs combine analog, digital, and nonvolatile-memory functionality with software tools in a flexible, cost-effective design and prototyping platform. Silego (Santa Clara, Calif.) announced in August that it shipped its 3 billionth device.  \u201cWhat Silego has developed is truly unique \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a mixed-signal platform which customers can configure to their design requirements on the fly, drastically reducing the time to bring their products to market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jalal Bagherli, Dialog\u2019s CEO, in a statement. Under the terms of a definitive agreement signed by the two companies, Dialog will pay $276 million in cash plus an additional consideration of up to $30.4 million contingent on sales and performance goals to acquire Silego. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Silego projects its 2017 revenue will be more than $80 million, with double-digit growth on top of that expected next year. The company has about 235 employees worldwide, most of whom are expected to join Dialog as a result of the deal. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is editor in chief of EE Times.
