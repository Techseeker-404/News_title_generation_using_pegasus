He called for accelerated work on wafer-level fan-out packaging and greater use of parallelism in EDA software. To gear up for 7nm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe had to literally double our efforts across foundry and design teams\u00e2\u0080\u00a6It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the toughest lift I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in a number of generations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d perhaps back to the introduction of copper interconnects, said Mark Papermaster, in a wide-ranging interview with EE Times. The 7nm node requires new \u00e2\u0080\u009cCAD tools and [changes in] the way you architect the device [and] how you connect transistors\u00e2\u0080\u0094the implementation and tools change [as well as] the IT support you need to get through it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Both AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Zen 2 and Zen 3 x86 processors will be made in 7nm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long node, like 28nm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and when you have a long node it lets the design team focus on micro-architecture and systems solutions\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than redesign standard blocks for the next process, Papermaster said. The CPUs and GPUs AMD is shipping today were among its first designs in 14/16nm nodes using double patterning lithography and FinFET transistors.  For that work, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour partnerships with foundries and the EDA industry had to deepen. In 7nm it requires even deeper cooperation [because] we have quad patterning on certain critical levels [where] you need almost perfect communications between the design teams,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Papermaster expects foundries will begin to use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography starting in 2019 to reduce the need for quad patterning. EUV \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould bring a substantial reduction in total masks and thus lower costs and shorten cycle time for new designs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFoundries will introduce [EUV] at different rates but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I urge them all to go as fast as they can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. To date, AMD has used Globalfoundries, its former fab group, to make its x86 CPUs and TSMC to make its graphics processors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have both been aggressive in 7nm and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for the industry. The gap has closed versus where Intel is at and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an incredible juncture in the industry that people have predicted and now were seeing it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Papermaster\u00c2\u00a0said.
