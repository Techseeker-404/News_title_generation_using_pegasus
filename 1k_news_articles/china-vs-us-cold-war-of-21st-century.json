Will the U.S.-China trade war become the 21st century equivalent of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union?   While China remains central to the global chip industry, the cross-border nature of semiconductor manufacturing in which IC design operates around the clock, wafer shipments circle the planet, and all are part of an integrated supply chain may help to obviate some of the worst effects of the current U.S.-China tariff war.  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation in Shanghai (Source: SMIC) Nevertheless, the damage done and the two sides irreconcilable, a permanent trade war would be the 21st century equivalent of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In that contest, the U.S. simply outspent the Russians. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear if the same strategy would work against Chinese leaders willing to invest billions on wafer fabs, only to close them a few years later. Investors sensed the reckoning in recent days, heading for the exits after China responded in kind to the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariff increases on $200 billion in Chinese-made products. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.73% on May 13 after Beijing responded with tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods. (By week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end, the chip index had made up part of that loss.) \u00e2\u0080\u0098The soft approach hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Fueling the uncertainty is the suspicion that hardline U.S. trade advisors ultimately seek to undo the commercial links between the U.S. and China, the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecoupling\u00e2\u0080\u009d of trade between the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest economies. That commerce is largely driven by technology.    James Lewis  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried the soft approach for 40 years and it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and author of a recent report on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chip ambitions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Chinese [leadership] will just blow you off if they think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not serious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lewis notes that stories of China strong-arming U.S. tech companies have long made the rounds in Washington, fueling a consensus in Congress that Chinese powerhouses like Huawei should be banned from the American market. The race to deploy 5G networks and Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first-mover advantage have further hardened that stance, with lawmakers now convinced that U.S. allies must choose sides when deploying emerging technologies like 5G wireless. Meanwhile, established technology segments are also suffering as a result of trade tensions and a slowing Chinese economy. For example, industry analysts cite geopolitical events as one factor suppressing the previously booming microcontroller segment. China is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest MCU market, but \u00e2\u0080\u009ctariff-and-trade battles between the United States and mainland China have added to uncertainty in the market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d IHS Markit reported in mid-May. Hence, the industry tracker is forecasting zero growth in MCU demand over the next year. That pessimism also reflects heavy chipmaker reliance on Chinese assembly networks. So, too, do consumer electronics giants like Apple and Dell. The iPhone maker and server vendor each saw their stock drop by more than 4% in response to growing trade tensions. Computers and electronics constitute the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of U.S. imports of Chinese products, accounting for an estimated $186.5 billion of the $539 billion in goods and services imported from China in 2018, according to U.S. trade figures. U.S. technology exports to China totaled $17.9 billion last year. Among them are Intel processors manufactured at its fabs in Hillsboro, Oregon, where it recently announced expansion plans. That huge trade deficit is among the political forces driving the current U.S.-China trade war. While China is a leading exporter of finished electronic products, it remains a net importer of chip technology as it seeks to move up the technology value chain. According to the CSIS report, only about 16% of semiconductors used domestically are produced in China. Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aspirational goal is to produce 70% of the chips that it uses by 2025. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggressive stance toward U.S. chipmakers seeking access to its huge market has heightened current trade frictions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exploitative trade policy is to squeeze U.S. semiconductors out of the China market while sucking Western semiconductor technology in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lewis noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere should be no doubt as to which outcome is best for the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that the Chinese market accounts for as much as 35% of global sales. With more electronics assembled there, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is central, if not absolutely critical, to both the market and the supply chain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jimmy Goodrich, SIA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of global policy.  Recommended  China Trade War Detours Supply Chain   Trade stalemate splits the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economies The overriding concern is that a trade stalemate would effectively separate the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest economies, a scenario for which neither side has a template. Such a split means that U.S. trading partners would eventually have to decide, for example, whether to buy 5G wireless chips from Qualcomm or Huawei. The Trump administration tightened the screws on May 15 with an executive order effectively banning Huawei from the U.S. telecommunications market. The sanctions also block Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to U.S. technologies, including systems that incorporate components made in the U.S. Huawei is thought to source as much as 20% of its components from U.S. suppliers, including processors deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritical to Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product offerings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to international trade attorney Lawrence Ward. Global chip suppliers, too, are under pressure to choose sides. German chipmaker Infineon Technologies, for example, confirmed a report by Nikkei that it has suspended shipments to Huawei of products that it makes in the U.S. in compliance with tightened export rules announced last week by the Trump administration. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little doubt that some in the Trump administration wish to sever trade ties with China after 40 years of economic integration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be easy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d notes Lewis, who suspects that we may end up with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cde facto decoupling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Xi Jinping has economic problems, and China is more vulnerable on technology trade because U.S. electronics companies possess what China wants. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a game of chicken, [but] neither side wants a head-on collision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lewis added. Reflecting the uncertainty on both sides and the prospect that an early-morning tweet from a protectionist U.S. president could scuttle a face-saving compromise, Lewis concludes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no idea how this will end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Check out all the stories inside this Special Project:     U.S.-China Trade Damages Done Despite trade negotiations that dragged on for months, the only discernible result was confirmation that \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncertainty\u00e2\u0080\u009d will indefinitely rule the future of the electronics industry and its markets.    Tech Warfare Outbreak Hits China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI  Economist Dieter Ernst tells us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe damage done by this outbreak of open technology warfare is likely to be much more serious and long-lasting than normally assumed in the media.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    China vs. U.S.: Cold War of 21st Century?  Tariffs and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order have replaced 40 years of economic integration. Vulnerable China could blink first in a trade war.     China Trade War Detours Supply Chain President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs were initially seen as a blunt instrument that would force other countries to drop their trade barriers. Nearly a year into the U.S.-China trade war, tech companies are accepting constant supply uncertainty as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe new normal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 George Leopold is the former executive editor of EE Times and the author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalculated Risk: The Supersonic Life and Times of Gus Grissom\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Purdue University Press, Updated 2018).
