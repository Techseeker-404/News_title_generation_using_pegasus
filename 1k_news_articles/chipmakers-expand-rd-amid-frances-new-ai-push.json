The strategy states data is a key competitive advantage in the global AI race, and it is therefore essential to have a data and AI policy if France and the European Union wish to attain the goals of sovereignty and strategic autonomy. It says this is especially significant to counter the dominance of digital giants in China, Russia and the United States, which have built up their positions by focusing on data collection and use and have a considerable head start.\u00c2\u00a0 The policy has ambitious goals, which it adds are necessary steps in the creation of a French and European AI industry, supporting research, encouraging startups, and collecting data that can be used, and shared, by engineers. France's AI strategy will focus on four sectors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 healthcare, transport-mobility, the environment and defense/security. French President Emmanuel Macron details France's new AI Strategy in Paris last week.  Speaking in an interview with Wired magazine, Macron said that problems such as the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica issue and with autonomous driving are created by the private sector and large corporations in the U.S. In contrast, he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChinese players collect a lot of data driven by a government whose principles and values are not ours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macron added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we want to defend our way to deal with privacy, our collective preference for individual freedom versus technological progress, integrity of human beings and human DNA, if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution.\u201d "}
