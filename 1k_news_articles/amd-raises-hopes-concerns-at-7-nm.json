The news also provided an example of the diminishing returns of leading-edge process technology and raised concerns about the quality of open-source code for accelerators. In a Twitter conversation tagging our story on the news, a scientific researcher in Germany lamented that the $10,000+ price tags on high-end Nvidia V100s make them \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing we can order easily with our funding guidelines.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A researcher in England called the prices, which can top $15,000 for buyers in Europe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot sustainable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pointing to Intel and Nvidia gross margins in excess of 63%. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Nvidia is making great products, but \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this problem can only be solved by increased competition in both the CPU and GPU markets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease step forward, AMD, Cavium/Marvell, Fujitsu, Ampere \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 our science is suffering due to the current situation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another person on the discussion thread posted a chart (below) showing the growing die sizes of Nvidia GPUs as the company pursued higher-performance parts.   First-generation Nvidia general-purpose graphics processors cost about $1,500, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe all worried at how expensive they were compared to consumer GPUs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one researcher, bemoaning a 10\u00c3\u0097 rise in costs.

But how much price competition comes with the new AMD parts remains to be seen. If the 7-nm products are more successful than anticipated, AMD could find itself constrained by the number of wafers that it can get from TSMC, now its sole 7-nm provider. Just before the parts debuted, Intel announced that it was focusing all of its capacity on high-end devices, claiming that it could not fill a resurgence of PC demand. However, overall demand is actually not rising; rather, Intel may have been trying to tempt AMD to go after low-end sockets, said analyst Mario Morales of International Data Corp. With the exception of a modest uptick in enterprise demand, the PC market is not growing. In fact, the market in China for desktops and notebooks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which represents the largest slice of the overall PC market \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is declining slightly, said Morales. "}
