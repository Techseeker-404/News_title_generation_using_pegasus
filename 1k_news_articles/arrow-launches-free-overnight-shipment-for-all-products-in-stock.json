As a result, these engineers need quick delivery of any critical component or product to ensure\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0they can finish their tasks on time. Of course, overnight shipping has been available for years, but for a price. While most engineers and\u00c2\u00a0managers agree that the additional expense is inconsequential compared to the cost of an engineer or team wasting time waiting for a component, the extra expense often raises complaints from purchasing managers, who argue that\u00c2\u00a0it\u00c2\u00a0is an unnecessary cost.\u00c2\u00a0 That is why Arrow, recognizing the challenge engineers face in meeting product development deadlines, is introducing free overnight shipping for the\u00c2\u00a0millions\u00c2\u00a0of products it has in stock.\u00c2\u00a0  Simply order in-stock parts on Arrow.com with a minimum purchase of $20 and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll arrive the next day without extra cost (no special code needed). With\u00c2\u00a0millions\u00c2\u00a0of quality components ready to ship,\u00c2\u00a0engineers\u00c2\u00a0can keep their designs moving forward today, tomorrow and five years out. \u201cFree overnight shipping will help engineers accelerate their path to production,\u201d said Darryl Shaper, VP of Digital Marketing for Arrow.com. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving to wait for an order to be delivered is a thing of the past. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineers need to quickly source the right components in order to continue driving innovation forward. Arrow recognizes this need and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re offering free overnight shipping on all in-stock components.\u201d For the engineer, free overnight shipping eliminates the stress of lead time ordering, where they must ensure that the parts they need are ordered well in advance, especially commodity components in high demand. Some distributors may have lead times of up to several months for certain parts and for the ones that they have in stock, it could take a week or more to deliver.\u00c2\u00a0 Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free overnight shipping offer also eliminates the challenge of order size \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some distributors actually refuse to address an order request if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too small. As long as the components are in stock and the minimum value of $20 is reached, Arrow will ship the order out overnight, free of charge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe common narrative we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing from engineers is the inability to source the right components quickly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Allison\u00c2\u00a0Sabia, Vice President and General Manager of e-Commerce for Arrow\u2019s Global Components business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe that free overnight shipping addresses this need and will help today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology innovators create tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading products.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Where is your challenge as an engineer?
