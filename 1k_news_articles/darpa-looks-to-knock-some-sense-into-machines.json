The basic research effort includes two technology tracks, the first focusing on fundamentals, or \u00e2\u0080\u009clearning like a child.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   The second includes developing models based on deep learning and other approaches to develop frameworks that can solve problems based on current AI industry benchmarks. The effort also provides momentum for academic research in this esoteric but vital area of cognitive studies that dates to the 1960s.\u00c2\u00a0 The DARPA program starts with the premise the machines lack basic knowledge about the physical world that all humans possess. Expressing and encoding that capability has so far confounded AI researchers who tend to focus on either narrow or general AI problems. Those models are considered \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrittle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d falling well short of human cognition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new territory [and] it turns out to be incredibly difficult,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Gunning, a program manager in DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Information Innovation Office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery [human] action is on top of this iceberg of common-sense knowledge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even a one-year-old child \u00e2\u0080\u009chas an incredible understanding of the physical world\u00e2\u0080\u009d that machines can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come close to matching, Gunning said. If the basic research program pans out, DARPA hopes to use the resulting models to develop new machine learning applications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get something started that will synergize\u00e2\u0080\u009d further industry development, Gunning added in an interview.\u00c2\u00a0 Potential common sense \u00e2\u0080\u009cservices\u00e2\u0080\u009d include models that learn from experience as might a child learning spatial navigation. Another would mimic a research librarian browsing the web to gather facts that could be used to provide common-sense answers to natural language or image-based questions about the physical world. One potential application dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009csensemaking\u00e2\u0080\u009d would augment AI systems that analyze sensor data. A machine common sense model could then help interpret and understand real-world scenarios. Another described by Gunning is a \u00e2\u0080\u009csimulated common sense agent [operating] in a 3-D simulated environment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gunning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office kicked the effort with a recent \u00e2\u0080\u009cProposers\u2019 Day\u00e2\u0080\u009d designed to brief potential bidders on program requirements. The agency said it would fund research exploring developmental psychology, then establish a set of cognitive development milestones for determining how the resulting computational models learn in three areas: experience learning, prediction and \u00e2\u0080\u009cexpectation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as problem solving.\u00c2\u00a0 A parallel effort will use web browsing to assemble a repository of machine common sense capable of answering queries based on natural language and images. The resulting \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroad common knowledge\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would mimic general adult knowledge will be tested against the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence benchmarks. Those metrics cover common sense understanding of natural language, machine vision and a form of inference known as abductive reasoning that seeks, for example, to infer intent. Participants in the DARPA program will be given test problems for which they must build a machine to answer a series of questions. Gunning said developers could use deep learning models, crowdsourcing techniques and other novel approaches to come up with a machine common sense framework that could help fill the current gap between narrow and general AI. Machine common sense and other DARPA efforts are part of its more than $2 billion portfolio of AI research programs aimed at advancing beyond current technologies that require large amounts of training data. Those approaches often fail to adapt to change and are unable to provide users with explanations of their results. As the global AI race heats up, with China and European countries announcing aggressive development roadmaps, the DARPA AI Next effort serves a de facto U.S. strategy. Google and others are pouring billions into AI research, and DARPA wants to augment those efforts with high-risk, high-payoff research into areas like machine common sense that may not deliver immediate commercial applications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to explore how machines can acquire human-like communication and reasoning capabilities, with the ability to recognize new situations and environments and adapt to them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d DARPA director Steven Walker said in unveiling the umbrella AI effort. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMachines lack contextual reasoning capabilities, and their training must cover every eventuality, which is not only costly, but ultimately impossible. Given the stakes in the race to develop AI technology, the machine common sense effort is reminiscent of DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pioneering work in developing networking technology most of us take for granted: The Internet. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 George Leopold is the former executive editor of EE Times and the author of  Calculated Risk: The Supersonic Life and Times of Gus Grissom\u00c2\u00a0(Purdue University Press, Updated, 2018).
