Both the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the SEMI trade group testified at a U.S. International Trade Commission public hearing Tuesday as part of the Administration's solicitation for public comment on the proposed tariffs. The SIA\u00c2\u00a0estimates that the proposed tariffs would impact about $3.6 billion worth of U.S. semiconductor chip imports from China and another $2.7 billion in products related to the semiconductor supply chain. In a written submission made prior to the hearing, the SIA argued that imposing tariffs on semiconductors and semiconductor-related products currently slated for tariffs would undermine U.S. leadership in semiconductors, handicap \u00c2\u00a0U.S.-based chip firms in relation to international competitors and threaten the market share of U.S. firms in China. The proposed tariffs would also cost U.S. exports and jobs, and raise the cost of manufactured consumer goods for U.S. consumers, the SIA argues. What's more, the SIA argues that imposing tariffs on imports of semiconductors and semiconductor related products would result in U.S. companies paying tariffs on their own products while doing nothing to curb Chinese policies and practices deemed by the U.S. to be anticompetitive. In the submission, the SIA says that since the majority of U.S. semiconductor imports from China are chips designed or manufactured in the U.S. that have been shipped to China for test and packaging, making import statistics for semiconductors from China a misleading metric. SEMI made a similar argument in its written submission, saying the tariffs would unfairly penalize U.S. chip equipment manufacturers, most of which buy components from China for their equipment. Many of these components and materials are not offered by U.S. vendors, and many are not widely available from any non-Chinese firms, according to SEMI.\u00c2\u00a0 SEMI's submission read, in part, \u201cWe worry that these tariffs will impact U.S competitiveness. Costs for U.S. semiconductor equipment companies will increase, while costs for non-U.S. competitors will remain the same. The net impact of this trade action will be that non-U.S. firms receive an advantage.\u201d Source: SIA  After failing to reach a deal with China to reduce a $375 billion trade deficit, the Trump Administration imposed 25% tariffs starting earlier this month on about $34 billion worth of mostly tech-related imports from China. An additional $16 billion worth of imports have been ticketed for the same tariff, set to go into effect in coming weeks. The Administration has also proposed a 10% tariff on another $200 billion worth of imports from China. U.S. semiconductor firms, the SIA and SEMI all support the aims of the Trump Administration to curtail China's industrial policies and practices around intellectual property. However, the industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as most economists and analysts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 oppose the tariffs, which they argue will ultimately harm the global economy and penalize U.S. companies and consumers. The SIA's submission to the USITC included the statement: \u201cUnfortunately, misdirecting penalties at the U.S. semiconductor industry, the proposed tariffs fail to curtail Chinese discriminatory trade and unlawful IP practices or provide the United States with meaningful leverage to press China to change its behavior.\u201d As an alternative, the SIA urges the U.S. government to \u201cutilize more effective and targeted policies,\u201d including combatting IP theft, greater utilization of the World Trade Organization and multilateral actions with allied countries to address the \u201cproblematic aspects of Chinese industrial policy.\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
