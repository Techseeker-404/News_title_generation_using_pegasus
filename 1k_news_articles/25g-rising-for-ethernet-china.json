Vendors leading the 25G charge are Cisco, AristaandH3C. White box vendors made up 5% of the market. Virtualization was just taking hold in servers in the mid-2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, but it has become standard for servers today.\u00c2\u00a0The new 25G networks are proving to be as impactful as 10G speeds that came to prominence back in 2004. Over the past decade, enterprise networks have transitioned to support multiple clouds over centralized and virtualized fabrics. A successful transition to 25G will provide a foundation for the expansion of mobile applications that require juiced performance.\u00c2\u00a0 Smart NICs from companies such as Mellanox, Accolade Technology and Netronome also are driving 25G growth. These intelligent networking cards drive better server utilization\u00c2\u00a0by offloading the host CPU from processor intensive tasks. Smart NICs had their genesis in widely adopted cloud principles for driving improved efficiency of compute and network assets, driven by underlying software defined networks. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cloud vendors sees 25G as an enabler to catch up.\u00c2\u00a0The cloud market in China is rapidly rising to the growth and maturity of its larger rival in the U.S., though in terms of market size it is still considerably behind. To its advantage, China has different power requirements than the U.S. and can use less power per server rack enabling unique rack designs.
