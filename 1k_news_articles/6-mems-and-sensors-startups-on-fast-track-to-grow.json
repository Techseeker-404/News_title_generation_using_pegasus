Everything is connected, from what we put in our bodies, what we have in our cars, our homes and our cities. Market research firm McKinsey predicts the IoT economic impact to be in the range of about $4 trillion to $11 trillion per year in 2025. MEMS and sensors are an essential part of it, and the question is how to take a bigger chunk of that pie. One answer comes from high-potential startups. The 2019 MEMS & Sensors Executive Congress (MSEC), organized by SEMI in Coronado Island, Calif., is a can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-miss event to take the pulse of the industry from some of the movers and shakers in the community. Heavily discussed and debated over this two-day conference, the Technology Showcase amplified awareness of the latest MEMS and sensors technologies and applications, including a DNA search engine, a 4D LiDAR for autonomous vehicles, as well as wearable biosensors for healthcare. Attentive audience during the MSEC conference sessions (Image: MSEC) Before unveiling the names and business activity of the six finalists, and disclosing this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s winner, here are current trends and thoughts about the reality of investments, consolidations in the MEMS and sensors industry and wise tips to create value and make a difference. A good way to maintain and heighten suspense. Lost in the cloud \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilicon Valley was founded in hardware, but it has got lost in the cloud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Marc Rippen, founder and CEO of Alertgy, developer of a non-invasive device to monitor blood glucose levels on demand, and winner of the MSEC Technology Showcase in 2018. As he was pitching for funding, Rippen said he mistakenly said his device was fab-built. Investors replied, he recalled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not a software company? We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do hardware companies, these guys are too expensive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luckily, \u00e2\u0080\u009call that is changing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rippen said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was hard to get an introduction to the real world again because people seemed to be lost to the cloud. But, he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompanies like Google are realizing they have to go back to devices. I am glad to see that, because those platforms are the stage software dances on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sharing a similar view, Mike Pinelis, president & CEO of Microtech Ventures, applauded the increasing pace of innovation in the MEMS and sensors industry and the resurgence of deep tech startups. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to appreciate the level of sophistication in our community. I think everybody paid attention to WeWork\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failed IPO. The good news is that deep-tech startups will see a swing back where people come to them and say \u00e2\u0080\u0098we really need to invest in more serious startups, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for us\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u201d Every week, Pinelis said, at least three to four MEMS and sensors startups are getting funded, and there are more than 1,650 groundbreaking MEMS and sensors innovations being developed in academia and industry R&D labs. This translates into opportunities for innovation and growth.  Recommended MEMS\u2019 Future Are Made in Paper  Consolidations With at least 1,800 MEMS and sensors companies on the market today, consolidations are inevitable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur industry is quite fragmented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pinelis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a few large companies, but we have a long tail of small and medium-sized businesses. There are a lot of niche players, which is a good thing, but it means consolidations will continue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a previous session, J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me Azemar, technical project development director at Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement, said \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsolidations are already happening, and we expect more, not only in the MEMS industry but also in the semiconductor industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A consolidation should not only add value to both companies, but it is essential to ensure a good price-to-revenue ratio, Pinelis stressed. For instance, he continued, Intel-Mobileye was a $15 billion transaction with target revenues of $100 million. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a price-to-revenue ratio of 150. In comparison, TDK-InvenSense acquisition amounted to $1.3 billion and target revenues were $400 million for a price-revenue-ratio of 3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to figure out how to have a price-revenue-ratio higher than 150.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Value creation Thinking about the technology is good, but trying to solve a big problem is better. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the value lays, said Pinelis, encouraging the audience to scout the marketplace, go to conferences, pay attention to market trends. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTry to have the mentality of solving the big problem, instead of thinking that you have a technology and need to find an application for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Similarly, Pinelis urged companies to adopt a dominating approach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be number two, try to come with a unique offering that will put you as the number one player, because you want to be in a position where you have the pricing power. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to compete on price.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The last word goes to MSEC 2018 Technology Showcase winner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy advice to startups is that failure is not an option. You are literally stuck in a space trap, and there is no way home unless you find out how to make it work. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
