For example, there may be a basic choice between electric versus hydrocarbon and then further specifics: scavenging and harvesting, solar, wind, gas, propane, methane, compressed air\u2026it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long list. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also normal to assume that the power source, which has been traditionally used, is the right one, especially when the design team has some experience with that approach. Yet a successful system design may require looking at the numbers, reevaluating the situation, and being objective. They also need to avoid \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrendy\u00e2\u0080\u009d feel-good solutions if the numbers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support them. Two recent examples, both coincidentally from MIT (or perhaps it is not a coincidence), show how unbiased thinking can lead to an innovative system-level design. The first is a drone, which had the objective of staying aloft for five days while carrying a modest load of about 20 pounds (9 kg). The drone is intended to be an airborne communications node, carrying equipment (cellular, phone, radio, internet) aloft to establish connectivity where existing systems are inoperative due to storms, floods, earthquakes, and other disasters. The MIT team which worked on the project (Figure 1) first looked at the obvious solution of using solar power. After all, that has been used successfully on other long-duration missions. Nonetheless, when they really went through the reality of operation, they found that solar was not the best way to go. A solar-based power system would need heavier batteries to store excess power (assuming that there was any) for nighttime, cloud, or high-latitude deployment. Thus, their final decision was to go the old-fashioned gasoline-power route with a 5-hp engine. The Jungle Hawk Owl team shows the thin glider with a 24-foot (7.3-meter) wingspan. (Image source: MIT)  The MIT press release, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEngineers design drones that can stay aloft for five days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d also discusses their key design and simulation tool, GPkit, developed by MIT Professor Warren Hoburg, that allows engineers to determine the optimal design decisions or dimensions for a vehicle given certain constraints or mission requirements. This tool allowed the team to consider roughly 200 constraints and physical models simultaneously and to fit them all together to create an optimal aircraft design, as well as assess the many design trade-offs. The team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final design, dubbed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cJungle Hawk Owl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d weighed just under 150 pounds (68 kg) and operated at 15,000 feet (4.6 km) for five days (Figure 2). The aircraft is launched from a moving vehicle. When the car reaches optimal take-off speed, the Jungle Hawk Owl clamp is released and the drone takes off. (Image source: MIT)  In another example, a spinout team has developed and is commercializing a drone that attempts to combine the best of both power worlds: gasoline and electric (Figure 3). In effect, they have created the aeronautical analog to a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) using the straight-hybrid architectural approach, wherein the gas engine generates electricity, which is then used to power everything: motors, electronics, and more. (In the more complicated parallel approach used in some HEVs, both the gas engine and the electric motors are sometimes used simultaneously in the powertrain, depending on charge and fuel status, load conditions, and other factors. This can be more efficient but is harder to control and has mechanical and weight penalties.) The hybrid gas/electric drones from MIT spin-out Top Flight Technologies offer significant increase in range, payload size, and power over battery-only counterparts. (Image source: Top Flight Technologies)  Using a so-called straight-hybrid approach makes sense because it allows for full-electronic smart control of the motors, which is done more easily and efficiently in the electric domain. Of course, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a trade-off in losses between the gas-generator stage and the electric-power rails, but the loss may be countered by the better control and increased efficiency of all-electric drive. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an interesting engineering trade-off requiring careful system analysis. The MIT press release, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHybrid drones carry heavier payloads for greater distances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d goes into some details and includes an interesting point about thermal concerns. Obviously, engines on drones must be small and lightweight, which, notes the press release, drives significant technical challenges related to excessive vibration and heat. The team developed a new engine/gearbox/generator combination to meet the system priorities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOften, the engine will literally melt because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running it so hot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Long Phan, who is co-founder, CEO, and chief technology officer of the MIT spin-out Top Flight Technologies. He added that, by \u00e2\u0080\u009cusing various heat transfer and control techniques, such as strategically incorporating small fans, cooling fins, and rubber vibration dampeners, the team solved those issues and initially slapped a prototype hybrid engine on a generic drone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their calculations predicted that the hybrid drone would fly for an hour, but instead, it flew for nearly 2.5 hours, with a 20-pound (9-kg) load and practical range of about 100 miles (160 km). Frankly, a missed prediction of that magnitude \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if it is on the favorable side \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has me puzzled. Perhaps they were too cautious in their modeling or the many uncertainties and tolerances added up in their favor for once? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sure like to know more! What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your view on gasoline versus all-electric power for long-duration, medium-sized drones and hybrid gas/electric power for lower-range ones?
