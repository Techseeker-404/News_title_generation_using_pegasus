The chief executive of Syntiant aims in 2018 to sample a novel machine-learning chip and raise a Series B to make it in volume. The startup is designing a 20 tera-operations/watt chip using 4- to 8-bit precision to speed up AI operations initially for voice recognition. It uses an array of hundreds of thousands of NOR cells, computing TensorFlow neural-network jobs in the analog domain. Syntiant will release a reference design pairing its sub-watt chip with an Infineon MEMS microphone. If it is successful, the two will collaborate on other designs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to make it extremely easy to add voice control to any kind of device,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Busch. The plan comes as Amazon, Baidu, and Google are ramping up OEM programs geared to spread their AI-powered voice services. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, the ecosystem is only supported by devices plugged into the wall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Busch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody is offering an always-on, battery-powered solution \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we can be a leader enabling that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Syntiant is using a processor-in-memory architecture defined by its CTO, Jeremy Holleman, a researcher at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte. Holleman published academic work in the area as far back as 2014 at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference. Another startup with academic roots, Mythic, is taking a similar approach using a 40-nm Fujitsu NOR cell. But it appears to be targeting imaging applications more than speech and has Lockheed Martin as a partner for use of its chips in drones.   "}
