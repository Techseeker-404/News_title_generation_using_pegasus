D.L.S. Electronic Systems, based in Wheeling, Ill., and Washington Labs of Gaithersburg, Md., were among some 16 labs to receive the awards. The other labs perform testing in areas such as food and microbiology.  To participate, a lab first submits a statement of qualifications. Labs need not be ACIL members, though the cost is higher ($1,200 as opposed to $450 for member labs). Labs select 40 clients to receive questionnaires. Those who fill out the surveys mail them directly to ACIL\u2019s program administrator. Although participating labs need not be ACIL members, the labs must have accreditation by a federal/state accreditation program or ILAC/NACLA Mutual recognition Agreement (MRA) signatory, such as The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), which meets ISO/IEC 17011 requirements.  Participating lab clients then receive postcards asking them to rate the lab based on six questions with responses of excellent, satisfied, fair, and poor:  How do you rate the data quality? How do you rate the laboratory\u2019s customer service? How do you rate the technical expertise of the laboratory and its staff? How do you rate the value received? How do you rate the timeliness of your report? As compared to the timeliness of other laboratories?  ACIL has given out these awards since 2010. DLS Electronic Systems participated for the first time in 2016, and Washington Labs has participated every year except 2011.
