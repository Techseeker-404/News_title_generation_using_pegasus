Among the noteworthy features of Bluetooth 5: Twice the speed, four times range, and eight times the advertising capacity for long range, more robust connections, better user experience, and smarter beacons. From the paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening section: The rapidly evolving and expanding IoT market provides big opportunities for device manufacturers. New applications and the huge increase of devices requiring wireless connections has also kept various wireless standard interest groups busy developing new standards or updating existing ones to fulfill IoT-specific needs. The projected market growth for IoT-related applications and devices varies but one estimate puts the figure at around 16% CAGR up to the year 2025. This wide range of IoT applications will require the use of not one but several wireless standards if all usage scenarios are to be realized. This in turn also implies that coexistence issues need to be addressed adequately. The increased demand for suitable gateway devices is obvious. According to market share estimates, Bluetooth will be used in 60 percent of all wireless devices by the year 2021 and Bluetooth low energy correspondingly in 16 percent of devices. Most of the increase will be seen in smart home, beacon, connected home, and wearables applications. According to the computer magazine Datamation, ABI Research is expecting Bluetooth with low energy shipments to have a CAGR of 34 percent between 2016 and 2021 [3]. Such growth requires the wireless standards to be extremely robust and dependable. What is also needed are manufacturers who utilize the possibilities allowed by the wireless standards to the maximum in their hardware offering and who provide easy-to-use and powerful software stacks. Bluetooth has already existed for almost 20 years and is used today in approximately 8.2 billion devices, so it has already demonstrated its robustness and dependability. To fulfill requirements set forth by the new IoT scene, the Bluetooth SIG announced the Bluetooth 5 specification in December 2016. The latest Bluetooth standard improves bandwidth, range, broadcasting, and coexistence features. Download the full White Paper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBluetooth 5, Refined for the IoT\u00e2\u0080\u009d. "}
