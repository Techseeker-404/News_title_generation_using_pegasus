I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just listened to 30 minutes of debate among experts and the public on the pros and cons of artificial intelligence (AI) in society on a phone-in show on BBC radio in the U.K. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that the focus of what worries most people is two-fold \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one is the robots or machines taking over or automating jobs while the other is the potential for what we might call \u00e2\u0080\u009cartificial general intelligence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is the image depicted in movies wherein robots can think for themselves. While mass-produced thinking robots might still be a few years away, in the engineering world, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already used to automation of many tasks, and the advance of Industrie 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a good example of this. As if to take this to the next step, a Lisbon, Portugal-based startup, MOV.AI, announced seed funding of $3 million to develop what it says is an \u00e2\u0080\u009cindustry-grade operating system\u00e2\u0080\u009d for autonomous intelligent collaborative robots that will help deliver what TechCrunch calls an \u00e2\u0080\u009cAndroid for robotics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The funding was led by Herzeliya, Israel-based Viola Ventures and San Francisco, -based NFX. Viola has investments in companies like Multiphy, which develops DSP and mixed-signal ASICs for data center infrastructure connectivity; Protean, which monitors IC biometrics from production and through its lifecycle; and ColorChip, which develops hyperscale optical transceivers. MOV.AI said that it is creating an ecosystem where developers, integrators, and manufacturers collaborate to produce smarter robots on a large scale for operation and production lines. Its OS is supposed to decouple hardware from software to simplify R&D and field implementation processes. It allows for adding sensors and actuators easily and integrating them for complex behavior, with the ability for field technicians to configure complex behaviors and multi-robot states. This should enable integration with robotic arms, safety programmable logic controllers, charging systems, backoffice enterprise software, and warehouse management software. CEO and founder Limor Schweitzer said that his mission is to contribute to a world where intelligent robots perform most of the common physical tasks and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree humankind to be more creative and productive and enable faster market scalability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will be able to transform human-operated mobile machines into autonomous robots that work safely together with people and other robots in any environment at all scalable levels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d NEXT PAGE:\u00c2\u00a0Robotics Drives AI Chip Growth\u00c2\u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
