In 2016, Cree struck a deal to sell Wolfspeed to Infineon for $850 million, but the companies called it off\u00c2\u00a0last year after the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) raised concerns about the deal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implications for U.S. national security. Cree  (Durham, N.C.) said the acquisition of the Infineon RF Power team and capabilities would complement Wolfspeed with additional technology, design, packaging, manufacturing and customer support. The Infineon RF Power business is a leader in offering transistors and monolithic microwave ICs (MMICs) for wireless infrastructure radio frequency power amplifiers based on both LDMOS and gallium nitride on silicon carbide (GaN-on-SiC) technologies, according to Cree.  Gregg Lowe  \u201cThis is a key element of Cree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth strategy and positions Wolfspeed to enable faster 4G networks and the revolutionary transition to 5G,\u201d said Cree CEO Gregg Lowe, in a press statement.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Reinhard Ploss, CEO of Infineon, said sellign the business would enable Infineon to focus on strategic growth areas while retaining a strong technology portfolio for the wireless market. The deal includes about 260 employees in California, Arizona, Finland, Sweden, China and South Korea. The deal also includes the main Infineon Power facility in Morgan Hill, Calif., which includes packaging and test operations for LDMOS and GaN-on-SiC. Infineon said it would support the transaction with a long-term supply agreement for LDMOS wafers and related components out of its fab in Regensburg, Germany, and that it would also supply assembly and test services out of its facility in Melaka, Malaysia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are looking forward to combining our strengths with Cree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gerhard Wolf, vice president and general manager of RF power products at Infineon. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
