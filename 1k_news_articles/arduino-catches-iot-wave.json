In the meantime, there are a lot of people that are changing the world by building anything and everything, especially in the area of IoT.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Arduino is used worldwide by hobbyists, amateurs, tinkerers, and young people first getting their feet wet in electronics, it has also formed the underpinnings of hundreds of noteworthy and successful commercial ventures, including the Pebble Watch and virtually all 3D printers and drones, according to Arts. Arduino is enjoying success in the IoT wave because its easy to use, relatively inexpensive, and supported by a large ecosystem \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all important factors, particularly for those who have limited experience with hardware. Arduino Nano board.  There are some indications that Arduino's momentum in large-scale commercial projects has been disrupted in recent years, principally by two major events: a rift between the Arduino founders a few years back that tarnished the Arduino brand and created confusion in the user community; and Intel's decision to discontinue its x86 Arduino platforms, which offer more performance than the 8- and 32-bit microcontrollers that serve as the processor for most Arduino boards.

The rift \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which occurred after one of the Arduino founders broke with the other four, resulting in two Arduinos offering and licensing products \u00e2\u0080\u0094 created a mess that is still affecting the number of designs using Arduino, though it was resolved in 2016, Benson said.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Intel's decision to stop supporting its Arduino products, including Joule, Galileo, Edison and Arduino 101, has also left a vacuum in the market, Benson said.  Duane Benson  \u201cWhen Intel had some [Arduino] products, there was a lot more interest in using those things, because that is more processing power,\u201d Benson said. \u201cBut with those being gone, we are back to seeing things that are a little less powerful.\u201d \u00c2\u00a0 But Arts and others say the pipeline of products using Arduino has never been more filled, largely because of IoT. They point out that for most IoT devices, the performance of the 8-bit AVR and 32-bit Arm microcontrollers that power most Arduino boards is more than sufficient. "}
