The administration is also reportedly working to beef up export controls to prevent U.S. technology from going to China. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on the tariffs that the Trump Administration announced earlier this month. The first of these measures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which would levy a 25% tariff on about $35 billion worth of Chinese goods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are currently set to take effect in less that two weeks, July 6. Many continue to believe that the China tariffs are part of a negotiating strategy by Trump designed to get a better deal to help reduce the $375 billion trade deficit with China. However, at this point, China has not yielded, announcing instead plans to measure similar tariffs on U.S. products, most of which are food related. [Sponsored: Learn more about Computer Vision for the Masses] The idea of imposing tariffs against Chinese products \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of which are tech goods or materials \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is almost universally opposed by economists, analysts and trade groups. While many applaud efforts to protect U.S. industries and intellectual property from policies seen as unfair, these experts and groups argue that tariffs will only serve to damage the global business climate and hurt U.S. jobs and wages. We've already reported on the sentiments of both the Semiconductor Industry Association and the SEMI trade group, both of which like the idea of exacting better intellectual property protections from China, but don't approve of tariffs, which they say will be bad for business. \u201cSupply management is reacting quickly to the unfolding U.S.-China trade dispute,\u201d said Tom Derry, CEO of the Institute for Supply Management, another \u00c2\u00a0trade group. \u201cSupply managers across most industries are looking to replace their Chinese suppliers with those from other countries, to avoid the import tariffs. And U.S. corporations are postponing investment because of uncertainty about tariffs. The first reaction is not good for the Chinese economy, and the second reaction is not good for the U.S. economy, which only goes to show that no one wins in a trade war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) expressed a similar sentiment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no question that China cheats and that its unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft are hurting America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manufacturing workers,\u201d said Jay Timmons, CEO of NAM. But rather than tariffs, Timmons wants Trump to hammer out a \u201cfair, binding, enforceable bilateral trade agreement\u201d with China. \u201cA trade war never benefits anyone, so rather than pursuing a piecemeal tariffs approach, now is the time to seize the opportunity before us and work toward a U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0093 China trade agreement that will benefit American workers for generations to come,\u201d Timmons said. Readers of EE Times have also shared their opinions on this issue in recent weeks. Since last week, we've been running an informal poll on select stories that deal with the tariffs. As of Monday (June 25), the vast majority of the 831 people who responded to the poll indicated that they believe that tariffs will be bad news for the U.S. economy and high-tech employment. We invite you to participate:                    Will the tariffs imposed by the Trump Administrative on Chinese products be a net positive or negative for U.S. high-tech workers?          Yes! The tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration will cause consumers to buy more U.S.-made products, ultimately leading to more U.S. jobs in tech manufacturing and elsewhere in the supply chain.        No. The tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration will be a drag on sales of U.S. technology components and other products, ultimately hurting U.S. high-tech salaries and leading to job cuts.        Neither. The tariffs will have no impact on U.S. tech jobs one way or the other.    "}
