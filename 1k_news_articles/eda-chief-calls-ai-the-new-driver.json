The advent of AI is a mile marker on par with the invention of the printing press and the steam engine, De Geus said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will drive the semiconductor industry for the next few decades because Big Data needs machine learning and machine learning needs more computation, which generates more data. This will impact health, transportation and other vertical markets as they go digital,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. AI made its first debut in a Synopsys product in 1986 in the form of an expert system called Socrates that evolved into its Design Compiler tool, he said. Today, Synopsys has several projects applying machine learning techniques to its chip design tools. One challenge with the rise machine learning today is \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have to be careful not to start so many projects you lose focus on the meat and potatoes\u00e2\u0080\u009d of chip design, he said in a brief interview after his talk. Representatives of a research center exploring use of machine learning in chip design said earlier this year that one hurdle is getting access to large data sets needed for AI, given the proprietary nature of design files. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you can show chip designers the value of AI, this will not be an issue, de Geus said. As for CMOS scaling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law is not dead, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just getting more expensive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0de Geus quipped, showing a slide indicating 10nm and 7nm design starts are still in an early growth phase. In a panel at the event, Synopsys technologists will discuss the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPath to a 2nm SoC\u00e2\u0080\u009d with experts from Samsung Foundry and Qualcomm. De Geus says that Moore's law \u201cisn't dead but it is getting more expensive.\u201d Image: Synopsys  Despite any debate over Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, technology is no doubt spreading its influence broadly. For example, de Geus noted Synopsys now has tools for silicon photonics designers that include simulation and layout tools for photonic devices. He gave the connected car as an example of the broad impact of technology. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor car manufacturers everything is changing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, noting self-driving cars someday will use AI, 5G and electric engines. A recent fatality with a self-driving car could raise legal issues about responsibility. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will need government intervention to make sure this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deadlock innovation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI-powered auto-taxis may pose new challenges to data privacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe butler car will know everything about you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adaptation to you will be surprisingly high because your privacy will be amazingly low\u2013advances will be so incredible that privacy may be looked at as an afterthought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The 10nm and 7nm nodes are still ramping, according to data from Synopsys on the first 500 designs in each node.
