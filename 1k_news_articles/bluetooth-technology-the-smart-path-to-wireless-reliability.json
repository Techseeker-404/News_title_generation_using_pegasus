Unlike wired data communications technologies, wireless technologies must share the transmission medium and multiple devices may try to communicate over the same wireless spectrum, in the same general area, and at the exact same time. When this happens, in-air collisions between data packets can occur which can make a packet unreadable by the receiving device and effectively lost. This challenge is especially true in unlicensed spectrum bands, such as the global ISM band, where a communications technology needs to accommodate potential interference from other devices using the same communications technology, as well as devices using other communications technologies that operate in the same band. For example, Bluetooth technology operates in the same 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band as Wi-Fi and technologies that utilize the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. As a result, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible for a packet being transmitted between two Bluetooth devices to be corrupted or lost if it collides with a packet being transmitted at the exact same time and frequency channel as other in-range Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or 802.15.4 devices. Other devices utilizing the 2.4 GHz band can also cause unwanted electromagnetic noise in the environment, including lights, microwave ovens, baby monitors, and garage door openers, to name just a few. In short, Bluetooth\u00c2\u00ae technology is a radio technology, and radio can be unreliable. Even so, Bluetooth technology is currently trusted to enable solutions across the IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT), including those in challenging environments. Consider, for example, the rapid growth in large-scale device networks, including sophisticated commercial connected lighting systems where hundreds and even thousands of nodes must communicate reliably.\u00c2\u00a0 Bluetooth technology is also powering robust location services solutions such as those being deployed by buildings and businesses to protect employees returning to work during the global COVID-19 pandemic. So how can this apparent contradiction be explained? Bluetooth technology employs a multitude of techniques to combat interference and improve reliability. A detailed explanation of these mitigation techniques can be found in Martin Woolley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paper on Understanding Reliability in Bluetooth Technology. In this article, we will look at how Bluetooth technology overcomes potential interferers and enables reliable wireless data communication by using two key techniques, adaptive frequency hopping and small, fast data packets. Small, Fast Packets When a device transmits some data, the digital bits that comprise that data are converted into analog symbols which are transmitted, one at a time on the selected radio channel. The symbols are transmitted at a symbol rate, which is a measure of how quickly you can change from one symbol to another, and therefore a given number of bits will take a certain elapsed time to be transmitted. The longer the transmission takes place, depending on the symbol rate and the number of bits to be transmitted, the greater is the probability that a collision will occur. Therefore, when trying to avoid collisions, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to be small and fast. Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) offers the fastest radio of the low power wireless communication technologies, with a symbol rate used by Bluetooth mesh of 1 Msym/s and up to 2Msym/s for point-to-point connections. For example, when compared to other low\u00e2\u0080\u0093power wireless mesh networking technologies, Bluetooth\u00c2\u00ae packets are typically half the size and four times faster. Having small, fast packets enables more efficient use of spectrum and significantly lowers the probability of collisions.  Bluetooth packets are hard to hit. As Szymon Slupik, CTO at Silvair and Chair of the Bluetooth Mesh Working Group, often says, the math is simple: the shorter the packet the fewer collisions. The reliability of any wireless system is all about spectral efficiency. According to Slupik, the size of Bluetooth mesh packets is one of the biggest reasons why Bluetooth mesh networking is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first wireless standard capable of meeting the enormous expectations of the IoT era.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Slupik is not alone in his praise for the packet. Woolley references the Bluetooth mesh packet in relation to scalability and capacity of a high-density device network. As Woolley says: The less radio airtime a packet requires, the lower the probability of a collision. The small packet size of Bluetooth\u00c2\u00ae mesh and the high symbol rate of the Bluetooth LE radio reduces the required airtime for a packet and means that Bluetooth mesh networks fare especially well in this respect. But Bluetooth packets don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just have size and speed on their side. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also good at avoiding conflict. Adaptive Frequency Hopping Spread spectrum techniques can increase the resiliency of a wireless technology in busy radio environments where collisions and interference are more likely to occur. Adaptive Frequency Hopping is a unique spread spectrum technique Bluetooth technology utilizes to avoid interference.  Bluetooth packets avoid conflict. To understand how Adaptive Frequency Hopping works, it helps to look at how Bluetooth technology divides the 2.4 GHz ISM band. First, like many wireless communication protocols, Bluetooth technology uses more than one radio channel. Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) divides the 2.4GHz ISM radio band into 40 channels, while Bluetooth BR/EDR divides it into 80 channels. A pair of connected devices have the opportunity to use their radios to exchange packets at precisely timed intervals. But in addition to this, frequency hopping occurs, with a radio channel being deterministically selected from the set of available channels using a channel selection algorithm. In this way, communication takes place using a frequently changing series of different channels, distributed across the 2.4 GHz band, thereby significantly reducing the probability of collisions occurring. Frequency hopping is not necessarily unique to Bluetooth technology. But what happens next is. In a given environment, some Bluetooth\u00c2\u00ae radio channels might not be functioning well, perhaps because interference is impacting them, whereas other channels are working reliably. Over time, the list of reliable channels and unreliable channels may change, as other wireless communication devices in the environment come and go. The primary device in a connection maintains a channel map which classifies each channel as used or otherwise as unused. The channel map is shared with the second device so that they each have the same information about which channels will be used and which will be avoided. Devices use implementation-specific techniques to monitor how well each channel is functioning. If it is determined that one or more previously working channels are no longer working well enough, the channel map is updated. Conversely, if a previously bad channel is found to be working well now, its status will also be updated in the channel map. Channel map updates are then shared with the second device. In this way, the channel map is kept up to date so that it is always the optimal subset of channels that are being used, avoiding problematic channels. This is the adaptive aspect of the Bluetooth adaptive frequency hopping system. Conclusion Adaptive frequency hopping and the size and speed of Bluetooth packets provide a glimpse into the techniques and features Bluetooth\u00c2\u00ae technology offers to help developers address the challenge of interference and optimize the reliability of their products and applications. Much of the system was designed with reliability in mind, and reliability in Bluetooth technology is more than just the sum of the reliability of its parts.
