I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it; she is a celebrated, award-winning, and globally recognized technology writer and media executive. Ask Junko, though, about her preferred title, and it will undoubtedly be, simply, journalist \u00e2\u0080\u0094 technology journalist, that is. This week, another title dropped into Junko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lap when she bagged the award for \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost Engaging Content\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the annual AutoSens event in Brussels. In addition to being my friend, Junko is also my colleague at ASPENCORE Media, where she is co-Global Editor-in-Chief and Chief of Correspondents, a position she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had for years and which she hangs onto because it means that she can continue to conduct interviews and write her award-winning articles. In the more recent role of Editor-in-Chief, she is the other half of my brain, my sparring partner, a bulldog with a point of view but who could be swayed with well-reasoned, well-researched, and balanced arguments. Junko is the one who I can trust to buzz me on Whatsapp early in the morning and at midday and even waking me up at midnight. The subjects do not deviate from ASPENCORE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s editorial plans. We discuss artificial intelligence, the internet of things, the industrial internet of things, automotive ICs, power electronics, 5G, 6G (really?), Apple, Nokia, Samsung, Renesas, IDT, Texas Instruments, Infineon, SEMI, Analog Devices, NXP, Qualcomm, STMicroelectronics, many other established chipmakers and systems developers, ASPENCORE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next wave of Special Projects, Silicon 75, startups that you may or may not have heard of but all of which are on her radar, which editors need feedback \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pleasant or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdifferent opinion to be executed as firm instruction\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as she would put it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 engineers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whims, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKing George\u00e2\u0080\u009d (one of her favorite editors and now a \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious author\u00e2\u0080\u009d), earthquakes and other natural disasters that may disrupt the supply chain, and whether or not a specific technology will wither on the vine. The discussion kicks off with topics like these, but they eventually veer off to the hidden gems of Paris, why Lausanne (Switzerland) is a fledgling technology center, Junko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest paintings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of which you can find on Facebook \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the man we both love and call Benj (no, that is not a spelling error), why she writes so much and so late into the night, the technology executives and analysts whom she recently met, why she travels so much and sleeps so little, and the sensitive subject of which wine would go best with her latest culinary adventure. As to the wine, we defer to Benj, who is still wondering why he \u00e2\u0080\u009cowes me a drink\u00e2\u0080\u009d more than 10 years after I made that demand. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer the question because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall why or care why, having drunk more than a few shots of Benj\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine spirits. We talk and laugh often about such mundane things and about knotty technology problems that we believe may never get resolved. Poor Benj has sated our tongues with delightful wine and spirits multiple times over the years in New York, Paris, and Bern. They were moments snatched from the delightful tedium of poring over technology innovations, chasing story leads, and writing about mergers and acquisitions, executive departures, and so on. Over the years, Junko has emphasized looking beyond the obvious news angles. We once developed a series for EE Times dubiously called \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the Heck Were They Thinking?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEE Times Confidential\u00e2\u0080\u009d was another project that foundered on poor funding. In the last year, Junko has led a more successful campaign refocusing the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading publications on insightful, in-depth, and wide-ranging reports. We dubbed these \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpecial Reports.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Under this program, ASPENCORE editors, freelancers, industry executives, and analysts sink their teeth into weighty subjects, approaching these from varied angles and developing a series of five or more articles that appeal to all segments of the industry. So far, the topics treated have included the following:  Engineering a Solution to the IP&E Shortage  The Day When the Industrial IoT Gets Hacked   Apple\u2019s $1 Trillion Climb   Mapping the Future of Electronics   Where Would Apple be Without Taiwan?   Where Did Qualcomm Go Wrong?   One Man\u2019s Quest for a Tesla   Uber Fatality Sends AVs Back to Safety 101   Focus on Taiwan   AI Flood Drives Chips to the Edge   Four Technologies Helping Drive Industry 4.0    Junko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion for the profession is deep and her belief in the art quite intense. She is a great but reluctant media manager whose devotion is to the craft of storytelling. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall ever discussing politics with Junko. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not disinterested; we just argue about and migrate toward the discussion of other subjects, such as: the global economy; if Apple will continue to dominate the consumer electronics market; why I must write a business analysis about Nokia, NXP, TI, or any other company temporarily on her editorial menu (I happen to be one of her favorite business writers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pat on my own back); whether AI can be trusted; and what needs to happen for autonomous driving to be truly safe.   Which brings me back to the award that AutoSens gave Junko. This award couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have happened five years ago. Junko Yoshida was not covering the automotive market then. She saw an opening one day and took it. After a spate of radical cost-cutting \u00e2\u0080\u009creorganizations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d EE Times ended up without a reporter covering the automotive market. Seeing an opportunity to expand her coverage area and learn about the sector, Junko dove in. Within months, she was breaking stories on the automotive IC sector. It was the same strategy that she successfully used years earlier to become the in-house specialist on China. I asked Junko what the AutoSens award meant for her. Her response is below. It sums up a point of view that I believe marks the ethos of the best journalists in this business. As a reporter, I got this automotive beat only several years ago. I feel I am incredibly fortunate because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met many people  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both inside and outside the industry  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to be my sources and willing to spend their time and educate me.  Autonomous Vehicles is a field where AI, sensors, and electronics meet. For me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such an exciting beat. I can use everything I have learned, and I still get to learn new things every day. I do feel blessed as a reporter.  The AutoSens award is another feather in Junko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cap.
