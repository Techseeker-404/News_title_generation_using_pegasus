Lam Research\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recently announced Striker FE enhanced atomic layer deposition (ALD) platform addresses semiconductor manufacturing challenges for 3D NAND as well as DRAM. It employs advanced dielectric gapfill technology the company has dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cICEFill\u00e2\u0080\u009d for filling 3D NAND and DRAM structures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as logic devices \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in emerging nodes. The need for gapfill methods isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t new, said Aaron Fellis, vice president and general manager of Dielectric ALD products, but the traditional ones no longer meet today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs, especially as 3D NAND is stacked higher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u2019re so tall and they have a number of different features that get etched through them to enable the integration of different steps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltimately, they need to get filled back up with a dielectric material, most commonly silicon oxide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Legacy techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, diffusion/furnace, and spin-on processes that are normally used as gapfill for semiconductor manufacturing are no longer viable for 3D NAND, Fellis said, due to trade-offs between quality, shrinkage, and gapfill voids. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey tend to shrink and distort the actual structure that the customer is building and designing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silicon oxide continues to be a preferred material for filling because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stable, withstands a wide range of temperatures, and exhibits good electrical performance. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changed is the technique for depositing it. In the case of Lam Research\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Striker ICEFill, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a proprietary surface modification technique to achieve highly preferential bottom-up and void-free gapfill while retaining the film quality inherent to ALD, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you use a standard ALD you get a much higher quality film as deposited, so you don\u2019t have to deal with shrinkage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Striker FE enhanced atomic layer deposition platform employs advanced dielectric gap-fill technology the company has dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cICEFill\u00e2\u0080\u009d for filling 3D NAND and DRAM structures.

ICEFill still provides very good quality film inside without shrinkage because of its bottom up approach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIts extendibility is very high.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This means there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complete gapfill at whatever step it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s required, he said, whether it\u2019s for mechanical strengthening of a structure or electrical performance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have a uniform and consistent material property in a particular gap inside the fabricated device.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Deposition techniques for memory devices have their own roadmaps that are driven by the advancement of various memory technologies that determine how existing techniques will last, said Fellis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThings keep getting taller or smaller.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the case of the challenges created by 3D NAND being stacked taller, Lam Research already had been working evolving its Striker product, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we saw a demand from our customer that we needed to improve the film performance as they moved along their own roadmaps. Stacking still drives continuous innovation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lam Research is a dominant player for ALD technology, said Risto Puhakka, president of VLSIresearch, and the demands of its technology reflect those placed on memory. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about increasing density for applications, such as artificial intelligence, that require more bits while keeping costs the same, and that includes gapfill capabilities as the memories such as 3D NAND are stacked higher, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stacking becomes more and more challenging from the manufacturing perspective, but the chip makers themselves get it a little bit little anxious about how much they have to spend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sticking with a known material such as silicon oxide adds some predictability because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well understood But just as 3D NAND stacking will eventually hit limits, so will the gapfill techniques and ALD technology, added Puhakka. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has its own roadmap and limitations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.
