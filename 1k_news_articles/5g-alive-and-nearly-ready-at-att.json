An AT&T lab manager in Austin sketched out the challenges making it happen. AT&T announced plans to make the 3GPP Release 15 version of 5G available in 12 markets before the end of the year. It will initially use a so-called hockey puck that supports high-speed Wi-Fi for consumer and business devices and links to the cellular net over 5G using the 28-GHz band. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDepending on the vendor, [the pucks use] 400- or 800-MHz channels, and in all cases, we see gigabit-type data rates that are pretty reliable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dave Wolter, an assistant vice president for radio technology at AT&T who runs the lab. So far, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe see some rain fade, but weather has not been as big a factor as some thought because the links are short \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about 100 to 300 meters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even the farthest links still get a Gbit/second, with probably more possible when you have line of sight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Currently the lab does not have equipment hardened for outdoor use. Thus, signals have some attenuation passing through windows. The next big leap, expected in 2019, is supporting mobile broadband on handsets and other devices. To get ready, the lab is conducting tests from a van in an area of Austin where it has set up four antennas. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still early days in a limited test area for beamforming. So far, the system handles 28-GHz handoffs between base stations with line of sight while the van moves at 25 mph. Using client antennas that are better than what actual handsets are expected to employ, devices have not dropped links and have hit data rates above 1.5 Gbits/s.

Rain and leaves can block millimeter-wave signals, requiring a new level of detail in planning cellular networks. The good news is that Wolter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group has found ways to use reflections even if a tree is between a user and a base station. However, the lab is still working through other issues. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just assume a 6-dB loss for clutter because you can get a rapid dropoff in signal from a corner of a building or foliage \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so network planning tools need to be re-examined \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 using ray tracing and other methods to determine if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get connectivity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.
