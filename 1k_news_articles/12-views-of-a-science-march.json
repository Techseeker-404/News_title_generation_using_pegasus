An estimated 7,000 people took part in San Jose, marching less than a mile from City Hall to a central park where speakers, food trucks, and a small science fair entertained the crowd. The crowd was a diverse mix including young coders, families, and retirees. A handful of engineers interviewed by EE Times said that distrust of the Trump administration motivated them to join the event. They pointed to proposed double-digit cuts in agencies related to the environment. One climate scientist who addressed the crowd painted a picture of a rising San Francisco Bay that someday could flood critical infrastructure, including the San Jose Airport. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re faced with a very serious adaption problem, but the good news is that we have quite a bit of power to not let this get worse for future generations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. One organizer of the local event, a doctoral student in biomedical engineering at the University of Santa Cruz, said that she got involved after taking part in the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s March earlier this year. Kimberly Bryant, founder of Black Girls Code, used her moments on the stage to call for diversity in tech. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a need to open a space for everyone to create the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  Organizers of the global marches called for a week of actions advocating for a larger role for science in policy and popular culture. \u00c2\u00a0They pledged to build \u00e2\u0080\u009can organization centered on informed advocacy, community building, and accessible education\u00e2\u0080\u009d for satellite cities that held events.
