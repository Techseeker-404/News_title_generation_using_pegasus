Towns and counties along the path endured years of planning and worry, merchants invested and hoped for big tourist payoff. Some travelers endured stiff lodging up-charges and price gouging on gas and parking, whereas others spent only a few hours in the car. Whichever route people took, the crowds coalesced to look up at the 2+ minute dark jewel-like spectacle in our sky on Monday, August 21. The most photographed eclipse didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappoint: we have beautiful photos, and even a mega movie.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhnGpgY2dI0 Future archeologists may discover a layer of eclipse glasses in the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strata along the path of totality. Fossils of organic material \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mostly leaves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are common in Eastern Oregon where I watched the eclipse. I was in the tiny town of Mitchell, OR, located near the John Day Fossil Beds. The Eastbay Astronomical Society, an astronomy club that started in 1920s in Oakland, California, took over town and filled it with campers and lodgers. We doubled the number the of townspeople for 4 days (there were approximately 150 of us in a town of 130). As a member of this club, I selected the town during my own eclipse planning because the center line ran through the John Day Fossil Beds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Painted Hills Unit and the town was nearby. The dry location and fairly reliably clear skies melded perfectly with the interesting natural history. The rest of the club bought into the location, too. One planner got our club to sell the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campsites for a whopping $250 a night, but you could pack in as many people as possible in the 10\u00d720 foot space. These campsites normally sell for $10 a night. We had little to no cell phone service and internet and the more people in town, the worse the internet got. What counted was that the weather was good although some forest fire smoke intruded. We could see the 2+ minute event very well. Despite the remoteness, on eclipse day, we saw reporters and photographers from Wired Magazine, Reuters and the local Bend paper. Culture clashWe certainly felt the ambivalence of the town during the planning. But again we are talking about a mostly volunteer government in Mitchell. It is such a small town. The ambivalence was laid bare in a sign near Klamath Falls, OR, on Hwy 97: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe eclipse is cancelled. Go home!\u201d it read. (On the way out of the state, the same sign said \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrive safely, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hear similar sentiments muttered under people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breath in the town of Mitchell but as the date got closer, the expected large crowds and the desire to cash in motivated more local people to sell RV spots on their land, to rent out their house, or sell in-town parking spaces. The town council also voted in a lodging tax: they went from a tiny lodging tax to a New York City-sized tax before all this was over. The eclipse may have some long-lasting effects in this area in the form of taxes and more dollars in the town coffers to fix those roads. Maybe they can now at least post their council minutes online now. This is a town so small it relies on exchange students to enable them to keep their school open. Some international students stay at the school and learn about rural life in America. To me, that meant the town had an unexpected tolerance for international visitors. In other ways, not so much. It took a long time to get the city to allow us to stage an outreach event: a lecture about the sun from a solar observatory scientist followed by a \u201cstar party\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the usual event we take to schools in the Bay Area, where we allow students to view through our telescopes. The City allowed the lecture to go on but inexplicably canceled the star party. Maybe they were turned off by the word \u201cparty.\u201d Who knows. They had seen our presentation and probably knew what it was. We held one anyway in our own eclipse viewing area.  We rented houses from a mother daughter team of hardworking, entrepreneurial German immigrants. It was like a window into our own immigrant past, only this time, the townsfolk seemed to forget their own recent family history of immigration to a country inhabited by Native Americans. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cus versus them\u00e2\u0080\u009d attitude of the town toward these hardworking immigrant ladies was surprising. One man called them German socialists but as far as I could see, they were the best capitalists in town. That man, who was outraged by what he thought was price gouging by \u00e2\u0080\u009cGerman socialists\u00e2\u0080\u009d, worked at the one tiny gas station in town that ended up charging $5 a gallon for gas during the event. In the end, it all of it came together and my club members were so happy and grateful for the experience. We were happy to drop some dollars in the town coffers. Our similarities may be greater than our differences: we are all small and insignificant under the sun, moon, and stars. Here are two accounts from Eastbay Astronomical Society astronomers, one of whom is the staff astronomer at the Chabot Space & Science Center in Oakland, CA. Both were took pictures of the eclipse and talk about their equipment. John CurrieThis was my first Total Eclipse experience.\u00c2\u00a0 I am certainly a rookie when it comes to eclipse photography (or any astro photography for that matter).\u00c2\u00a0 I did a search for eclipse photography and found several options.\u00c2\u00a0 Since I use a Windows laptop, one of the most favored choices was \u00e2\u0080\u009cEclipse Orchestrator\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Moonglow Technologies. The software provided me with a base script of photographs to be taken and allowed me to tailor that script for the number and type of photos that I wanted to take.\u00c2\u00a0 I was able to test the script several times in advance of the actual eclipse to be sure that the camera (Nikon D7200 DSLR) would respond correctly.\u00c2\u00a0 I ended up with more than 300 pictures that I am still sifting through, but so far, I am quite pleased with the results. \u00c2\u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
