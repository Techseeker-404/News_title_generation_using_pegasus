It refers to \u00e2\u0080\u009cConnected\u00e2\u0080\u009d cars, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutonomous/Automated\u00e2\u0080\u009d driving, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShared,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cElectric.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Among these four axes of development, it seems that two are gathering more Research & Development (R&D) compared to others. The first one is related to the electrification of OEMs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fleets. Indeed, the EU has set CO2 emission reduction targets: 95g/km in 2021 and 81 g/km in 2025. With these targets, OEMs have few alternatives but to electrify vehicles.

OEMs are expected to achieve this goal with the addition of many sensors and advancements in computing performance necessary to process all the data generated by the sensors. Drivers for Car Electrification The electric and hybrid electric vehicle (EV/HEV) market is growing rapidly and will reach more than 30 million new vehicles in 2025, according to Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimates. Altruistically, developing electrification to address social and environmental challenges is a response to several strong and sustainable drivers (Figure 1). Among the most important benefits are the reduction of CO2 emissions from passenger vehicles and the reduction of air pollution in densely populated areas. Electrification can also be pragmatic since strong governmental CO2 emission reduction targets are forcing car makers to significantly reduce their fleet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average CO2 emission levels to avoid heavy penalties. Electrification of the vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powertrain enables significant reductions of CO2 emissions and thus becomes a mandatory part of the car makers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 strategies. Figure 1: Strong and sustainable drivers for clean mobility. (Image source: Yole) After more than two decades of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaving the way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d dominated by a handful of EV/HEV manufacturers, we have entered the phase of massive deployment of EV/HEVs by both traditional mainstream car makers and emerging OEMs. In a market with historically high barriers to entry, electrification is enabling a host of new start-ups, though many are unlikely to reach mainstream acceptance. Car manufacturers across the world are releasing a large portfolio of electrified vehicles, giving customers the freedom of choice amongst different vehicle electrification types and vehicle designs. Driving range is increasing, pricing is becoming more affordable and most importantly, and EV charging infrastructure is being widely deployed. All these factors increase customer motivation or reduce prior reluctance to purchase an EV/HEV. Different Types of Electric Vehicles Among the different types of electrified vehicles, we distinguish hybrid electric vehicles, which contain both electric and internal combustion motors, and full electric vehicles with electric powertrain only. Full electric vehicles with zero CO2 emissions are considered the ultimate goal of electrification of the passenger fleet. However, such a transition from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles to full electric vehicles cannot be done overnight because of constraints in technology, cost, raw material, and manufacturing. The lack of charging infrastructure has also been a critical barrier. Traditional automotive OEMs are progressively adopting electrified vehicles at the risk of cannibalizing their ICE car sales. They must bear the burden of existing ICE-related manufacturing facilities, employees, distribution, and sales networks. They must develop new intellectual property, engineering, and capacity to manufacture electric vehicles, often in isolation from traditional ICE manufacturing. The whole automotive supply chain must be rebuilt, and this will take some time. Therefore, a transition period exists where vehicles with different levels of electrification are offered to customers (Figure 2). Hybrid electric vehicles offer various levels of CO2 emission reductions compared to an ICE vehicle, from a small percentage for mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEV) up to about 50% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Figure 2: Different EV/HEV categories and their CO2 emissions. (Image Source: Yole) The transition from HEVs to full EVs In the past two decades, the EV/HEV industry was dominated by full-hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), mainly driven by the commercial success of the Toyota Prius introduced in 1997. As a result of strong governmental CO2 emission reduction targets, improvements of Li-ion batteries and their cost reduction as well as many other factors (Figure 3), the automotive industry is following an \u00e2\u0080\u009caccelerated electrification trend\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a faster transition toward vehicles with longer electric-mode driving range (mileage) such as PHEVs and BEVs. Indeed, PHEVs and full EVs offer the significant reduction of CO2 emission required by car makers to reach CO2 emission reduction targets and avoid heavy penalties. Figure 3: The initial strategy path for vehicle electrification has been accelerated by several singular events, including incentive mechanisms, and penalties in the case than car makers do not reach the tough CO2 emission reduction targets set by different governments. (Image source: Yole) Both PHEVs and BEVs are rechargeable vehicles; they can be charged from the electricity grid, using preferably electricity generated by clean energy sources, such as photovoltaics, wind, and hydroelectricity. PHEVs have an electric mode driving range of approximately 50 to 80 km. Because PHEVs can be used in full electric mode, they also reduce emissions of air pollution in cities, but that contribution can be limited with the full electric mode only suitable for short-distance city commuters. To enable longer electric-mode driving range, reduce the CO2 emissions and improve the environmental impact of e-mobility, innovations are needed in batteries, power electronic devices and systems and car designs. The main trends related to power electronics technology include the adoption of SiC and GaN semiconductor technologies in the traction inverters, onboard chargers, and DC-DC converters, enhanced device packaging technologies (silver sintering die attach, copper wire bonding, wire-bond free interconnections, Si3N4 AMB (Active Metal Braze) ceramic substrates, high-temperature epoxy encapsulation) and mechatronic integration of different systems. The key objectives for improved range are to increase the power density while reducing the volume and weight. Other developments serve to improve overall reliability and reduce manufacturing costs. While some of the increased popularity of electrification is being driven by heightened consumer awareness, a significant attribution should be granted to accelerated engineering pace of the automotive industry.
