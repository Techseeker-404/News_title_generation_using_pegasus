While most of the news has focused on AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential for good, some pundits are now pointing out its potential for harm. They include none other than Elon Musk. As the founder, CEO, and CTO of SpaceX and the CEO of Tesla, a key player in the emergence of the self-driving car, Musk is certainly no Luddite. When he talks about AI, he is talking about technology that is absolutely integral to his business model. Nonetheless, Musk believes it is imperative that society regulate the advance of AI, as he noted in an interview before an audience at the National Governors Association Summer Meeting this month. In the course of the interview, Musk referred to his \u00e2\u0080\u009cexposure to the most cutting-edge AI\u00e2\u0080\u009d and warned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think people should be really concerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The point is not to live in dread of the potential repercussions of AI and respond reactively to them, he said, but to plan proactively for them. That would require a break with past patterns of behavior in dealing with technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unintended consequences. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNormally, a whole bunch of bad things happen. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a public outcry. After a few years, regulations come out. Then companies oppose that. Anyway, it takes forever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Musk noted. Society doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the luxury of waiting to see what happens with AI, Musk argued, because AI poses a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The consequences of earlier technological disruptions have included \u00e2\u0080\u009ccar accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs, or bad food\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is to say, outcomes that have been \u00e2\u0080\u009charmful to individuals but not to society as whole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Musk said. In contrast, AI poses a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfundamental, existential risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think people appreciate that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he is pushing for regulation now. As a businessman working in the highly regulated auto and space industries, Musk said he appreciates that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fun being regulated\u00e2\u0080\u009d and declared his opposition to \u00e2\u0080\u009cover-regulation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nonetheless, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really think we need government regulation\u00e2\u0080\u009d on AI, and it should be done \u00e2\u0080\u009cpronto.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Urgency is needed, he said, because the nature of competition in the industry will compel companies to \u00e2\u0080\u009crace to build AI.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If your competitor is building AI systems, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be crushed\u00e2\u0080\u009d if you fall behind. That\u2019s why it\u2019s necessary for \u00e2\u0080\u009cregulators to come in to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You have to pause to make sure this is safe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Musk said. If they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo that for all teams in the games,\u00e2\u0080\u009d individual companies will feel pressured to accelerate AI development. AI is already developing rapidly, he pointed out. In response to a question from Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Musk illustrated \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe remarkable achievements of artificial intelligence\u00e2\u0080\u009d with an account of how quickly DeepMind had gotten its AlphaGo to progress from beating the single best human player of the game Go to playing multiple top-ranked human players simultaneously and beating them all. Before AlphaGo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s win, it had been assumed that it would take at least 20 years for the AI to get to the level of beating a person. He cited another DeepMind project, in which AI taught itself to walk \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom nothing within hours\u00e2\u0080\u0094way faster than any biological being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Why does Musk find AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress so alarming? For starters, AI could manipulate information and tamper just enough with systems to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstart a war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He posited a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpurely hypothetical\u00e2\u0080\u009d example to illustrate how that could work and what might motivate it: \u00e2\u0080\u009ca goal to maximize the value of a portfolio of stock\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is \u00e2\u0080\u009clong on defense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a worst-case scenario that sounds like a movie plot, which is why people might be tempted to shrug it off. There is a more real and present danger, however, and Musk touched on it in passing. There \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly will be a lot of job disruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause robots are going to be able to do everything better than us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean all of us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then acknowledged that he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot sure what to do about this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Society may be waking up to the fact that automation translates not just into greater efficiency, but also into fewer jobs. A July 19 article in The Wall Street Journal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRobots Are Replacing Workers Where You Shop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d details some of the tech that is already replacing human staff at Walmart stores. It includes a table from Citi Research on the threat to jobs from automation by the year 2030. At the best end of the spectrum is insurance and finance, with a high-risk rate of 54 percent. At the worst end is accommodation and food services, with a high-risk rate of 86 percent. That would amount to a huge number of people booted from their jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a sea change that would not just harm the displaced individuals but could prove devastating to society and the economy at large. Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fears about an AI future appear to center on nefarious plots of the type that make for good films, but the more mundane danger of automation-related job loss warrants serious attention. Like Musk, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the answer, but we have to begin by asking the question. We cannot risk the unintended consequences of accepting all technological progress as good. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ariella Brown is a writer, editor and social media consultant based in New York.\u00c2\u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
