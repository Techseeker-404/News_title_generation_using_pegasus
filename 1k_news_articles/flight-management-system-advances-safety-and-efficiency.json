The global commercial aircraft market is projected to reach $255 billion by 2028, up from $191 billion in 2018, according to ResearchAndMarkets, while the global commercial drone market is expected to grow from $2.7 billion in 2017 to $10.3 billion by 2022, according to Allied Market Research. The connected FMS is designed to deliver the best combination of safety, security, and fuel and operations efficiency by leveraging the greater availability of data from on-board and open-world sources such as weather information, resulting in better decisions by the flight crews. By providing pilots with the right information at the right time, the FMS will enable improved performance and reactivity to the aircraft during complex phases of flight, said Thales, and calculate alternative trajectories in real time to propose or react quickly to changes of plan. The game-changer is the capability to use both on-board and open-world data. For example, by combining the FMS and the electronic flight bag flight functionalities, aircraft trajectory can be permanently controlled and enhanced, which results in optimized flight, decreased fuel consumption, and improved passenger comfort. Thales\u00e2\u0080\u0099 PureFlyt connected flight management system (FMS) leverages both on-board and open-world data to improve safety, security, and fuel and operations efficiency. (Source: Thales)  The company, using massive testing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, simulated 2 billion test cases, which is equivalent to 100 million actual flight hours. The commercial aviation market is one of the first industries to adopt AI for aircraft manufacturing, which is expected to significantly improve future operations, according to ResearchAndMarkets. The importance of AI in the aircraft value chain has resulted in the adoption of AI technologies for more efficient operations. Thales has also future-proofed the new FMS to support the implementation of new design concepts such as the Initial 4D (I4D) trajectory management methods currently being researched by SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) in the EU and NextGen in the United States. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy increasing the accuracy of flight in four dimensions, the fourth dimension being time, PureFlyt will enable more effectiveness in maintaining optimal distance between aircraft, particularly in the demanding phases of departure and approach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Thales. PureFlyt will be available for entry into service in 2024 for both line-fit and retrofit. "}
