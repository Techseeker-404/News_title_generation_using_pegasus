Last year, the company announced it had scaled these cells to 40nm, but until now these cells have been fabricated with R&D process tools that differ from those used for high-density, high-volume memories in production fabs. The 4DS Interface Switching ReRAM technology is area-based as cell currents scale with cell area and the wiring therefore scales accordingly, the company says, and the technology is also based on well-understood physics and chemistry. In a telephone interview with EE Times, 4DS CEO Guido Arnout said now that after scaling down to 40nm and showing both predictability and repeatability,\u00c2\u00a04DS felt it was the right time to approach IMEC with its unique cell. The collaboration will demonstrate 4DS\u2019 production backend-of-line (BEOL) process on IMEC\u2019s CMOS megabit memory vehicle processed at 300mm wafers to make 1Mb devices, he said.\u00c2\u00a0 Arnout said flash is getting cheaper by the day, so competing with it means undercutting prices significantly. 4DS, however, sees a gap between flash and DRAM for another storage-class memory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe space between flash and DRAM is huge,\u201d he said. As one of the leading microelectronics R&D organizations in the world, IMEC is in a strong position to help 4DS tweak its technology for finer geometries and learn everything it can about its cell in terms of yield, speed and endurance for commercial production, Arnout said. \u201cWe can\u2019t cut corners because we don\u2019t want to fail,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we cut corners, we won\u2019t get the answers.\u201d  4DS\u2019 ReRAM includes a patented cell structure and operation called MOHJO\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0metal xxide hetero junction\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a non-filamentary switching mechanism. Doing such work in a research foundry concept is an efficient solution, said Lode Lauwers, IMEC\u2019s vice president of business development and sales, as these projects build the confidence and the level of maturity by which potential fabs will consider adopting such processes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFabs introduce new materials all the time, but they only do so if one has sufficiently demonstrated the prevailing properties and addressed the potential side effects to assure that no showstoppers occur,\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Lauwers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssessing those options as complete as possible in the R&D phase is one key element in IMEC\u2019s programs.\u201d NEXT PAGE: The Promise of New Materials\u00c2\u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
