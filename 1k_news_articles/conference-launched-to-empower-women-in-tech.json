That uprising and a controversial memo penned by an ex-Googler triggered a series of debates on \u00e2\u0080\u009cwomen and tech.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Articles began to pop up about the misogynist culture of Silicon Valley, Hollywood, the U.S government, etc. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 until the year ended with a viral tsunami called #metoo. In short, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe woman card\u00e2\u0080\u009d got a lot of play last year.\u00c2\u00a0 While the spotlight shining on the gender gap was both welcome and overdue, we also found, unfortunately, that decades-old stereotypes about women were hardly dead.\u00c2\u00a0 Worst of all was the canard that women are not proportionally represented (and leadership) in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not interested or because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re biologically and emotionally unfit to do science. You hear that, Madame Curie? Media coverage and \u00e2\u0080\u009cconversations\u00e2\u0080\u009d about women in technology have kept the tech-world gender gap front and center. At EE Times, we prepared a global report on Women in Tech: 25 Profiles in Persistence. Our goal was to get up close and personal with women in tech, to understand what motivated their professional choices, how they got to be where they are, and what people and forces helped them along the way. Band and bond together  However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be the first to acknowledge that these efforts are hardly enough to lift women to equal status overnight. Women in tech need to bond and band together with their sisters. For instance, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sudha Kasamsetty, the founder of VerveCon\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 an educational conference designed for \u00e2\u0080\u009cwomen in tech.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0  Kasamsetty, an engineer by education and training, who formerly worked at companies such as Google, Tellme Networks and SurveyMonkey, has used her wits, spunk and experiences persuading backers and volunteers to launch VerveCon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaugural conference at Santa Clara Convention Center in California on\u00c2\u00a0Feb. 9, 2018. (Source: VerveCon)  The conference expects 300 to 350 attendees. It will feature top-notch guest speakers \u00c2\u00a0from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Slack, Uber and others covering a range of topics on emerging technologies including AI, BigData, IoT, Data Science, Containers, UI Building. The conference bills itself as an opportunity to \u00e2\u0080\u009crefresh and upgrade\u00e2\u0080\u009d skills and learn \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to apply them\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe relevant\u00e2\u0080\u009d in an ever-changing landscape. I met Sudha last November through a mutual friend. From my own experience, I know that organizing any conference is a challenge. It's not for the faint-hearted. Doing it in Silicon Valley, where conferences spring up day in and day out, struck me as bold. But most important, I was impressed by Sudha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methodical, engineer-like approach in envisioning this gathering. She saw VerveCon as an opportunity to solve problems of women \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or their absence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in technology enterprises.\u00c2\u00a0 She styles the mission of this conference as \u00e2\u0080\u009cengineering education.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She believes that arming women in tech with the most up-to-date industry and technical knowledge is the only way to advance their careers in the STEM workforce. \u00c2\u00a0 Asked about her inspiration for VerveCon, Sudha told me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am an engineer and I have been to many conferences myself. I have always felt that women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation is very low in technical conferences, sometimes less than 3 percent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This prompted her to create a survey and reach out to 300 women. She said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the shocking facts that came out of the survey is that women rely three times more on reading technical journals rather than attending a conference to update themselves with latest technologies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The survey revealed that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to find corporate budget for women engineers to travel. To make the matter worse, women themselves are now conditioned to believe that attending a conference has little impact on their careers. Sudha hopes to change this perception. She said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I got connected to the cause. We are bringing this conference to the heart of Silicon Valley at the Santa Clara Convention Center.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She explained that every talk will be interactive. The goal is that every woman who attends can go back to work and apply what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned at VerveCon. The VerveCon program shows 30 talks and five panel discussions.\u00c2\u00a0 For example, its dedicated career track provides attendees an opportunity to learn how to be more assertive, while exploring their leadership potential. Further, Sudha has put together an after-conference \u00e2\u0080\u009cissue-based mentorship\u00e2\u0080\u009d program. Those who attended VerveCon can follow by requesting to be paired with a mentor who, ideally, can help \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake the next step in their career or find a solution to a vexing program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the organizer. Asked why this conference, Sudha made it clear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all know we need more women in tech. But we also need the women who are already in tech to spend more time together to build a strong community \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly in Silicon Valley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Describing the Valley as \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere tech seems to permeate everything we read, touch and talk about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sudha noted that a forum like VerveCon is needed \u00e2\u0080\u009cparticularly in these times when we are hearing brave voices of women coming out of the dark to talk about the pervasive problem of sexual harassment at work. There is strength in numbers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So why is the conference called \u00e2\u0080\u009cVerveCon?\u00c2\u00a0 Verve means enthusiasm and energy, Sudha said. VerveCon, thus, is \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor all the enthusiastic women in tech.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be attending the conference on\u00c2\u00a0Feb. 9th, moderating a couple of panels. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to meeting with lots of women engineers to share our experiences and hear their stories. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times    "}
