Numerous free and open source projects were benefiting from collaboration among developers worldwide, and effective collaborative software development processes were being created and shared. With the advent of Agile development processes, the circle of collaboration expanded to include the client. The quality of software continued to improve, and software itself aligned more with the client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectations. As the profession welcomed psychologists as collaborators, user interfaces improved. Users became less likely to make mistakes that would lead to harm or even death. Best practices began to mature. We adopted a collaborative approach to develop this update to the code of conduct. More than 3,000 computing professionals worldwide commented on three working drafts. Since the impact of computing reaches into most people's lives, the code makes clear that technical expertise alone is no longer sufficient to be a successful computing professional. Many computing professionals\u2013even those with strong liberal arts backgrounds\u2013do not have the depth of knowledge and experience in psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, ethics, design and communication theory necessary to fully analyze the impact of complex software systems, especially as they are being built. Experts from those fields who have experience in computing need to be drawn into collaborations as an integral part of the practice of computing in order to advance computing excellence. Through collaboration, the computing profession will offer the best technology for the common good. The code\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principles consistently emphasize this need. For example, principle 3.7 calls on computing professionals to be aware when computing systems are becoming part of people's everyday lives. Professionals must be attentive to a system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing impact after it has become part of society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infrastructure. Effective stewardship involves relying on experts from areas other than computing. This expertise can also be found in computing ethics, a field that has matured to include subdisciplines that intersect with diverse areas of study. These experts have something to offer the computing profession, and because of their multidisciplinary focus, they understand the collaborative model. The updated ACM Code of Ethics expresses the conscience of the computing profession and is a call to think differently about the nature of computing. It guides professionals in taking a more expansive approach to computing. A widespread, collaborative, and open practice of applying the updated code when designing and implementing systems will improve the computing profession as happened with the collaborative software development methodologies of the 1990s. The profession has benefited from broadened collaboration in the past. Much is to be gained by expanding the circle again. Implementing this change is no easy task. We can start developing this expertise by considering the code along with every action taken and by inviting collaboration. Principle 3.1 provides direction. It states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnsure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No single computing professional is equipped to think through all of the social and ethical implications of a computing system when it is under design. It is a complex job that requires additional expertise. Some software is of little ethical importance, while other software has the potential to change the nature of what it means to be human. The value of the profession rests, in part, on effective ethical analysis and decision making. \u2014 Marty J.
