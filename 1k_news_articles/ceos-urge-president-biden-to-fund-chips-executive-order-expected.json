The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) board of directors, CEOs and senior executives at leading chip companies sent a letter to President Biden urging him to include substantial funding for semiconductor manufacturing and research in the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic recovery and infrastructure plan. SIA represents 98 percent of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue. The context laid out in the letter said the share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the U.S. had decreased from 37 percent in 1990 to 12 percent today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis decline is largely due to substantial subsidies offered by the governments of our global competitors, which have placed the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage in attracting new fab construction. In addition, federal investment in semiconductor research has been flat, while other governments have invested substantially in research initiatives to strengthen their own semiconductor capabilities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The SIA letter urges President Biden to prioritize semiconductor investment to reassert U.S. technological leadership and fulfill the goals of the Biden administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuild Back Better\u00e2\u0080\u009d plan.\u00c2\u00a0 The CEO signatories on the letter are from AMD, Analog Devices, Cree, GlobalFoundries, Intel, Lattice Semiconductor, Marvell Semiconductor, Maxim, Micron Technology, ON Semiconductor, Qorvo, Qualcomm, Silicon Labs, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Western Digital, Xilinx and the SIA. In addition, senior executives from Broadcom, IBM and Nvidia also added their signatures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSemiconductors power essential technological advancements across healthcare, communications, clean energy, computing, transportation, and countless other sectors, and chip-enabled technologies have helped keep us productive and connected during the pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u00afsaid John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy investing boldly in domestic semiconductor manufacturing incentives and research initiatives, President Biden and Congress can reinvigorate the U.S. economy and job creation, strengthen national security and semiconductor supply chains, and ensure the U.S. remains the leader in the game-changing technologies of today and tomorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By enacting the CHIPS for America Act in the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Congress recognized the critical role the U.S. semiconductor industry plays in America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future. Now, SIA calls on the administration and Congress to fully fund the provisions authorized by the NDAA to make them a reality. The White House response In the White House press briefing on Thursday, press secretary Jen Psaki said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe administration is currently identifying potential choke points in the supply chain and actively working alongside key stakeholders in industry and with our trading partners to do more now. At the same time, we are looking down the road.\u00c2\u00a0 The longstanding issue with short supply of semiconductors was \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which was the question yesterday \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is one of the central motivations for the executive order the President will sign in the coming weeks to undertake a comprehensive review of supply chains for critical goods.\u00c2\u00a0 The review will be focused on identifying the immediate actions we can take, from improving the physical production of those items in the U.S., to working with allies to develop a coordinated response to the weaknesses and bottlenecks that are hurting American workers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked how seriously the White House was taking the issue and whether the review would take months, she responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to sign an executive order soon, so he certainly is taking \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only three weeks in.\u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking pretty quick action. But as is true with many policies, we want to take a comprehensive look at the most effective steps that we can take as an administration, across agencies that will have a role to play, to address what has been a longstanding challenge, which is the shortage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
