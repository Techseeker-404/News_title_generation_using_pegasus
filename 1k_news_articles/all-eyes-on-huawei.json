As we witnessed, the consumer press was easily distracted by Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $2,600 foldable handsets on the show floor. But a battle royal between Huawei and U.S. officials (separate from mobile operators in different countries) is reportedly roaring behind closed doors in Barcelona. All eyes are on Huawei. The Huawei problem, however, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited to politics. Last year, Huawei was the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third largest semiconductor \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuyer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Gartner. Let that sink in. If Huawei becomes a pariah for Western countries, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fallout? What are the unintended consequences in the global market? Consider the supply chain. Consider the telecom equipment market. Consider IP theft issues and long-term U.S.-China trade relations. And really, how did Huawei\u2019s legal woes get so big? Is there any way for Huawei to get its groove back? During the same week of the Mobile World Congress 2019, EE Times chose Huawei as our topic for the latest AspenCore Media Special Project. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve examined not just the political posturing directed at Huawei, but also the impact that such overheated rhetoric might affect the electronics industry. Check out all the stories inside this Huawei Special Project.      Huawei and Decades of Doubt Yes, Huawei is caught up in the trade spat between China and the U.S., but its behavior going back nearly two decades has elicited widespread suspicion and distrust.    Carriers, OEMs Seek Huawei Clarity Removing Huawei equipment that\u2019s already installed is fraught with difficulties. Furthermore, it\u2019s not clear removal is necessary, let alone shunning the company\u2019s gear from the start. What\u2019s a wireless company to do?    Timeline: History of Huawei\u2019s Legal Woes in the U.S. Practically since the moment it first established operations in the U.S., Huawei has found itself accused of intellectual property. More recently the U.S. has also accused Huawei of violating export control laws and posing a risk to national security.    U.S.-China Crisis: Fallout for Chip Industry We asked Dieter Ernst, economist, how his views on the U.S.-China have changed in recent years. We also wanted to know how badly the global electronics industry might be damaged as the U.S.-China relations deteriorate.    Would a Huawei Boycott Unravel the Supply Chain? The global supply chain is facing a dilemma. As governments in the U.S. and Europe ramp up their rhetoric against Huawei\u2019s perceived threats to security and intellectual property, the firm is at the same time becoming a more important customer.    Getting Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Groove Back Huawei has historically done a poor job engaging with markets.
