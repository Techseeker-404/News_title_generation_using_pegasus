The Skynet project, launched by the OpenSingularity Foundation, envisions a network of intelligent machines (as in the movie \u00e2\u0080\u009cTerminator\u00e2\u0080\u009d), utilizing blockchain, IoT, and AI to create secure trusted networks of devices that can intelligently communicate with each other autonomously and on a large scale. The organization says that this will enable billions of interconnected identifiable IoT devices to participate effortlessly in a global machine-to-machine (M2M) economy powered by self-organizing AI networks with data integrity facilitated by blockchains, which provide solutions for device identity, secure decentralized micro-payments, and trusted communication.

It hopes to then have \u00e2\u0080\u009cbillions\u00e2\u0080\u009d of connected devices deployed by August 2022, according to the timeline on its website.  rinivasa Rao Nagaram  Last month, OpenSingularity made a pair of prize hires of former Qualcomm engineers. Srinivasa Rao Nagaram, who joined as director of engineering, was previously director of engineering at Qualcomm, where his work led to the inception of the Snapdragon processor. OpenSingularity says that it hired Nagarajam because of his expertise in SoC design, software enablement, and end-to-end product commercialization. Venkat Tangirala, a 22-year Qualcomm veteran, joined OpenSingularity as its ecosystem director. At Qualcomm, Tangirala helped complete its 5G modem pre-silicon development. Carl Shi, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm, also joined OpenSingularity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board this month. Several other members of the team have come from roles within Qualcomm as well as backgrounds with Alibaba, Google Ventures, Samsung, and Motorola. "}
