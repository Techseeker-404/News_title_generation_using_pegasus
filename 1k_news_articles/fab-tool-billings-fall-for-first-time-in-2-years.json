The three-month rolling average of billings for North American chip equipment firms slipped to $1.94 billion in November, down 4.2% compared to October and down 5.3% compared to November 2017, according to the SEMI trade association.  Ajit Manocha  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the first time in over two years, billings of North American equipment manufacturers are down relative to the same month the year before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ajit Manocha, president and CEO of SEMI, in a press statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter reaching historical revenues earlier this year, billings activity is decelerating in line with weaker growth expectations for 2019.\u00e2\u0080\u009d November marked the first time that fab tool billings declined on a year-over-year basis since May 2016.  Recommended  Fab Tool Sales Expected to Decline in 2019   Despite slowing growth in recent months, global sales of semiconductor equipment are expected to set an all-time high for the second-straight year in 2018. SEMI recently forecast that global semiconductor equipment sales would grow 9.7% this year to reach $62.1 billion before declining by 4% in 2019. The trade association also projected that tool sales would bounce back to grow more than 20% in 2020 to reach $71.9 billion.   \u00c2\u00a0 "}
