Of a variety of sensors designed for ADAS features, the race is most competitive and concentrated in computer vision. Vision is the most broadly used advanced sensor. One crucial question in the ADAS market is who will contend in 2019 as an alternative to Intel/Mobileye \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the most dominant player in the computer vision-based ADAS market. Candidates include NXP, Texas Instruments, and Renesas. New to the club is Ambarella, Inc., a Santa Clara, California-based developer of high-resolution video processing and computer vision chips. Ambarella revealed this week a collaboration with HELLA Aglaia, a tier-two developer focused on computer vision software for the automotive market. HELLA Aglaia is a full subsidiary of HELLA, a German tier one based in Lippstadt. Hardware differentiation  Although Ambarella\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exposure to the automotive market thus far has been limited mostly to dashcams, Chris Day, vice president of marketing and business development at Ambarella, is hopeful that the partnership with HELLA Aglaia will change that picture. Ambarella is confident that it can go head to head with TI, NXP, and Renesas on ADAS, based on Ambarella\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-performance computer vision processor CV22AQ CVflow that runs at an extremely low power,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Day. Running typically below 2.5 W, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe next generation of ADAS camera and computer vision processor can fit in a single, tiny box placed at a windshield, for example. OEMs or tier ones have no need to worry about thermal limitations in that box.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In contrast, competitive ADAS vision processors that run as high as 15 W would require a two-box solution, according to Day. While a camera fits in one box, another box would be required to house a computer vision processor, he added. Why consider Ambarella?  Asked why OEMs and tier ones should consider Ambarella with other vision platforms already out there, Kevin Mak, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics, told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir CVflow architecture and small die (10 nm in CV22AQ) enables a highly efficient performance-per-watt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ambarella is no novice in the world of ADAS and autonomous vehicles. Since 2015, when it acquired VisLab, the Vision and Intelligent Systems Laboratory at the University of Parma, Ambarella has had its sights set on the highly automated vehicles sector. VisLab team has been spearheading efforts to develop both a deep neural network and stereovision process and optimize its software to Ambarella\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive quality CV22 vision processor. The vision processor offers an image signal processor (ISP) and massive artificial intelligence (AI) computing performance.

The HELLA Aglaia/Ambarella partnership isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exclusive, however. Strategy Analytics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mak told EE Times that HELLA Aglaia already has \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe open vision platform with NXP and the front windshield camera partnership with Renesas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Why do OEMs want \u00e2\u0080\u0098open\u00e2\u0080\u0099 solutions?  The most oft-cited criticism of Mobileye \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite high chip performance and a leadership role in the ADAS market \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is that its solution is \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack box.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But if the computer vision software inside the black box works, who cares if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a closed system?
