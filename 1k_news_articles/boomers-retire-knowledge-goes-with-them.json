But as baby boomers retire, are they taking their experience with them? Is their experience even relevant to millennials and do millennials care? Based on the findings in the 2018 Pulse of Engineering survey conducted by IEEE GlobalSpec, it appears that companies do little to pick the brains of experienced engineers before the leave.   Knowledge loss was one of the many aspects of the survey. Other included number of projects, reasons for leaving jobs, and the constant pressure to do more with less. The one that struck me as the most important was that of knowledge loss.   Fig. 1  shows that 61% of the 2,236 respondents say that knowledge loss is extremely or very important. Of course, \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery\u00e2\u0080\u009d are vague at best. You can add another 24% who say that knowledge loss is moderately important. Yet only 2% say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not important. But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who the people that gave such answers are. Perhaps they are consultants or work at startups with just a few young employees.     Fig. 1: Some 61% of engineers say that knowledge loss matters. Source: IEEE Globalspec.   The next result, in which 65% say that their company has no formal practices for transferring knowledge (Fig. 2 ), makes many companies appear to drop the ball. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say that informal knowledge transfer doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen, for we know it does.     Fig. 2: Sixty-five percent of respondents say that their company has no formal procedure for knowledge transfer. Source: IEEE Globalspec.   Some people prefer not to transfer knowledge, especially as they get older. Why? Because some want to have unique knowledge and see it as a way to keep their job. I saw that firsthand wherein one aging engineer had been at the company so long that he was the only one who could support customers still using the previous generations of products. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking capital equipment here, which tends to be in use for 10 to 20 years. When he retired, the company had nobody left to support those customers. Of course, there were fewer of those old machines in use every year. The engineer had no chance of changing to a new position, but he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want one anyway.   If knowledge isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being transferred, then where do millennials get their information? First, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ask if part of the reason for lack of knowledge transfer is that millennials don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider the knowledge of older engineers to be relevant. I think that this is more software-related than hardware-related. Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t younger engineers more familiar with programming languages or software tools than veteran engineers? Indeed, programming languages and software skills top the list of skills that both sets of engineers feel that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to improve to change jobs (Fig. 3 ). But the survey doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain the difference between \u00e2\u0080\u009cprogramming languages\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csoftware skills.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Fig. 3: Programming and software skills top the list of what engineers think that they need to improve to change jobs. Source: IEEE Globalspec.   If the industry is lacking in knowledge transfer or millennials feel that the knowledge of veteran engineers is irrelevant to them, then where does new knowledge come from? Fig. 4  gives us some ideas.    Fig. 4: Engineers have many options for getting information to improve their skills. Source: IEEE Globalspec.   I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised to see online videos at the bottom of the list with just 16%. I suspect that this percentage is higher among millennials and lower among baby boomers. I prefer to read about how to do something as opposed to watching a video \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is, unless I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to take something apart to fix it. Having a video is often better than looking at photos or drawings.   Another interesting difference between millennials and baby boomers is in their preference for registering to get information. Millennials tend to think that online content should be no charge and that they shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to even register (Fig. 5 ). You might liken that to an older person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding that it costs money to produce and post technical content and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to pay for something of value.    Fig. 5: Millennials prefer to not pay and not register to get technical content. Source: IEEE Globalspec.   Improving on skills is one way to improve your chances of being hired for a new job. Engineers change jobs for a host of reasons. The reason for leaving differs depending on age, as very few young engineers leave to retire. Fig. 6  compares millennials to veteran engineers, which we must assume are those older than the oldest millennials. Of the veterans, a whopping 35% say that they will leave their jobs to retire. Of course, that can be interpreted in many ways. Does a 40-year-old expect to stay at his or her job until retirement or are the veteran respondents age 60 or older? We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.    Fig. 6: Some 35% of veteran engineers expect to leave their jobs for retirement. Source: IEEE Globalspec.   As you might expect, over half of the millennials expect to move to a different company, but when? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear. Furthermore, I think that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a missing category here: Start my own company. IEEE might be surprised as to how many young engineers consider that an option.   The survey covers several other aspects of working as an engineer. As with any other survey of engineers, they will indicate that the competitive landscape is getting harder and that they are constantly asked to do more with less. We see that in both downturns and upturns in the economy. In downturns, staff is reduced in greater proportions than the loss of work to be done \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or so it always seems. During upturns, it always seems as though employers are reluctant to hire as many engineers as they really need.
