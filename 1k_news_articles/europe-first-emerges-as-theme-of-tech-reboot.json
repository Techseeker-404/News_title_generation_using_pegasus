As Leti hosted its 50th anniversary, the heads of the two research and technology organizations sealed a deal and discussed plans to work together, aligning their microelectronics innovation agenda in Europe. \u00c2\u00a0 Marie-No\u00c3\u00ablle Semeria, Leti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, told reporters, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy putting European large projects under a single roof, we can go faster [with our R&D], together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0 Under the agreement, Leti and Fraunhofer set up \u00e2\u0080\u009ca technological platform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Semeria, so that they can provide small, medium companies and startups access to advanced technology. Included in that vision, she stressed, is to keep microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing in Europe. The new agreement between the two research institutes is aimed at funding \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0not just for themselves but for the microelectronics industry in their regions \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0from each of their national governments.  \u00c2\u00a0 The two are also working toward \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertification\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the European Union to elevate their project to status of an \u00e2\u0080\u009cImportant Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI).\u00e2\u0080\u009d The ultimate goal is funding from the EU, \u00e2\u0080\u009chopefully in the second phase [of the project],\u00e2\u0080\u009d Semeria said. \u00c2\u00a0 For non-Europeans, obtaining from the EU an IPCEI badge sounds like bureaucratic wheel-spinning. It is, however, a critical step, issuing to a transnational project a free pass to state aid without breaking EU financing rules. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about fostering growth and competitiveness in the EU. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at stake is our competitive advantage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Semeria. With new technologies and market segments such as AI and IoT rapidly emerging, Europe must be mindful of its own \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomic sovereignty\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrategy sovereignty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Europe needs to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cindependent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d must keep \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe knowledge of advanced technology\u00e2\u0080\u009d and hold \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritical access to defense and security capabilities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0 As China aggressively pushes its own state industrial policy to build an indigenous semiconductor industry, Europe sees it as fair game to consolidate some of its collected industrial power and establish its own technology policy. \u00c2\u00a0 Fraunhofer Group for Microelectronics Chairman Hubert Lakner put it bluntly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to promote that Europe is a good idea. And if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it now, Europe will become an appendix of Asia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00c2\u00a0 Four pillars of the European project Semeria emphasized that Europe has technological strengths and priorities distinct from other nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 microelectronics industries.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Europe, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer about CMOS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Semeria. Instead, the European industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus is more on \u00e2\u0080\u009cderivatives\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore than Moore\u00e2\u0080\u009d technologies. She cited \u00e2\u0080\u009cFDSOI, sensors, power electronics and compound semiconductors\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the four pillars of the Leti-Fraunhofer project.
