Founding members of the caucus include Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Steve Daines (R-Mt.). Spearheading the optics initiative are Reps. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), and Brian Mast (R-Fla.). Morelle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s district includes Rochester, the industrial and academic hub of the American optics, photonics and imaging industries (Kodak and Bausch & Lomb were both founded there). The goal of the caucus is \u00e2\u0080\u009censuring our nation remains the global leader in light-based technology innovation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morelle said. Optics and photonics technologies \u00e2\u0080\u009cquite literally light the way for our future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The congressional push for photonics innovations and the scaling of manufacturing is also backed by the Defense Department, which relies on precision optics technology for a range of weapons. The Pentagon is promoting the technology through efforts such as the National Imperative for Industrial Skills launched in November 2020. The initiative includes a precision optics consortium. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to have a skilled workforce that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rightly sized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adele Ratcliff, director of industrial base analysis and sustainment in DoD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Industry Policy. DoD\u2019s Adele Ratliff \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to have a coordinated approach on investments, starting with early research,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ratliff added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we have to move into applied technology, helping to bridge across from the art of possible to the art of practical. We have to have that investment in manufacturing scale-up in this country with that coordinated effort on workforce.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ratliff concluded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we have to help create that aggregated demand signal for how this technology can be used so that our investors in the United States will invest in our companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Promoters of light-based technologies note its close ties to semiconductor manufacturing, another national priority. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntegrated photonics use semiconductor fabrication and packaging processes to produce photonic integrated circuits\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ed White, chairman of the National Photonics Initiative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis means we get the benefits of semiconductor fabrication in the optics and photonics fields.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Added White: \u00e2\u0080\u009cImproved accessibility at affordable prices have and will continue to propel advances in central processing design and efficiency. It seems like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a safe bet to look forward to having all-optical processors in 20 to 30 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The optics push comes as Congress considers funding for a range of U.S. semiconductor, AI, 5G and quantum computing technology initiatives authorized in this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military spending bill. Lawmakers have yet to fund provisions of the Chips for America Act. A bipartisan group of legislators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York is expected to introduce a funding bill shortly. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear whether the R&D spending legislation includes funding for photonics R&D or skills training, congressional sources said.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
