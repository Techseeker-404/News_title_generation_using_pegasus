As Hock Tan noted in his offer letter, the two had privately discussed merger possibilities and clearly Qualcomm had not agreed, triggering Tan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hostile bid. At the very least, Qualcomm owes it to employees and shareholders to push for a higher price and better terms. That is indeed the big message it sent with its short public statement, offered without comment, that the $70/share offer \u00e2\u0080\u009cdramatically undervalues the company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wall Street liked the move, sending Qualcomm shares up and Broadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s down each about a point, Reuters reported. So far, Hock Tan is standing firm. Broadcom was quick to release a statement saying its $70/share offer represents a 28-33 percent premium on Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent stock prices. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the neighborhood of a typical deal, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the best house on a block as rich as this one. Tan is hoping he can stir up some investor unrest, but he may have to up the ante to do it. We may see a couple rounds of bidding given Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm stance, claiming it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board decision was unanimous after \u00e2\u0080\u009ca comprehensive review\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the offer with legal and financial advisors.  I doubt this is just a matter of the amount of money. I suspect Paul Jacobs doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see the company he helped grow and his father co-founded as part of what Tan calls \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Broadcom platform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The clash of cultures is as huge as would be the exits of executives and engineers under the cost and management constraints Tan would no doubt impose. Tan will have to find other levers besides cash and stock if he wants to acquire Qualcomm. I think anything that derails Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to acquire NXP would be a sufficient pain point to make Qualcomm relent. Qualcomm needs to strengthen its position given the slowdown ahead in smartphones and the historic consolidation of the semiconductor industry in the last three years. It cannot survive Wall Street and activist shareholder pressures as it is. I disagree with the statement from chief executive Steve Mollenkopf that \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo company is better positioned in mobile, IoT, automotive, edge computing and networking within the semiconductor industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With NXP that might almost be true. But without it, Qualcomm has a relatively small foothold in automotive, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much better positioned than any of half a dozen ARM licensees in IoT and edge computing. I think this deal is in the hands of four regulators who are pondering Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to questions regarding the NXP deal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably about licensing practices around its cellular patents. I think Tan knows the best chance of Qualcomm getting approval for any major merger is through divesting its patent portfolio. Its licensing practices have sparked major legal battles with Apple and regulators around the globe. Tan would not hesitate to sell this crown jewel, but I suspect Jacobs never would. So, there will be a back and forth for a while about money. But in the end the deal is all about patents, licensing practices and regulators. If the EU, Chnia and other regulators approve Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid for NXP it may escape Broadcom. If they do not, Hock Tan may get both. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times  Related posts:  Broadcom Launches $103 Billion Bid for Qualcomm Semiconductor Merger Mania: A Change From Historical Norms?
