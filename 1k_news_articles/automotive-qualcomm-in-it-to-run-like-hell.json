Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tailwind lately is coming from the confluence of the 5G, AI, ADAS and car-to-cloud trends. Car OEMs are desperate to catch up with the new \u00e2\u0080\u009csoftware-defined vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u009d model, believing it can help them generate post-sale revenues from software upgrades for new apps, bells, whistles, and services over a vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifespan. The company has spent a lot of time and effort getting to where it is now. Twenty years ago, Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial foray into automotive was connectivity, which made it a player in the in-vehicle infotainment market. Since then, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role has substantially grown. During the virtual event, Qualcomm discussed its lead in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cellular V2X and AI in digital cockpit which has thus far garnered design wins from more than 20 carmakers. Qualcomm also announced an extended relationship with General Motors. Under the agreement, GM is replacing its current ADAS system with one based on Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Snapdragon Ride Platform. Qualcomm declined to reveal when it might get into GM\u2019s cars. Nonetheless, the GM design win is a shot in the arm for Qualcomm, long viewed as a laggard in the ADAS market. Qualcomm claimed that numerous unnamed OEMs are working on Ride-based ADAS systems.

(Source: Qualcomm) \u00e2\u0080\u0098Open and Scalable\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Qualcomm executives made a concerted effort to pitch \u00e2\u0080\u009copen and scalable\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a new mantra in promoting both the Snapdragon automotive cockpit and ride platforms. The Ride Platform, for example, comes with pre-integrated and pre-validated software ranging from a perception stack and driving policy to parking assist and driver monitoring. The software is hardened and optimized by leading industry partners such as Arriver (a software unit of Veoneer), Valeo and Seeing Machines, to fit into the platform, Qualcomm said.

(Source: Qualcomm) With \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe automotive sector evolving at an incredible speed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a key trend cited by Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president and CEO-elect, Qualcomm believes having an open platform with qualified software from key partners \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rather than spending time developing its own software \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is crucial. This remark came off as a subtle dig at Mobileye, Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s competitor. Qualcomm is delegating to OEMs these scalable roadmaps integrated with commercial software. The goal is for OEMs to implement them swiftly while Qualcomm, also, \u00e2\u0080\u009cruns like hell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president & GM, automotive, at Qualcomm Technologies. Nakul Duggal (Source: Qualcomm) In an exclusive interview with EE Times, Duggal stressed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe work with partners with hardened commercialized solutions that are actually tested with miles on the road, across various parts of the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Duggal underscored the importance of software written to a safety standard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not using something that just works in a demo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Qualcomm offers OEMs solutions deployable right away, because they \u00e2\u0080\u009calready meet NHTSA and NCAP requirements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. Partnership is also essential to the Snapdragon cockpit platform. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are one of the few companies who will say we are very happy to work with Google on Google automotive services,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duggal. Snapdragon also works with Alexa. Citing Alexa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popularity, he noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are able to integrate that into a DSP.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While styling itself as an \u00e2\u0080\u009calternative\u00e2\u0080\u009d to competitors such as Mobileye, Nvidia and NXP Semiconductors, Qualcomm projects humility in its approach, and seriousness about tackling the automotive market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTransportation is a complicated global business. So, our approach has always been, we want to work with partners, whether it is in a specific industry, whether it\u2019s in a specific technology, a specific region,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stressed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to bring the best solution into our platforms. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why our platforms are always very open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Qualcomm also emphasized that it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the automotive market for the sake of generating shock and awe about self-driving vehicles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are in a business of scale, not in a business of headlines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stressed Duggal. This remark appears also aimed at Mobileye which has committed to launching consumer AV in 2025.  Our interview with Nakul Duggal on EE Times on Air. 5nm SoC coming For ADAS, Qualcomm sees Level 2+ as a sweet spot. But it is also making its Snapdragon Ride Platform truly scale. Announced at the conference is that the Ride Platform is now scaled down to New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) Level 1, ideal for NCAP windshield-mounted ADAS. With this addition, Snapdragon Ride supports the spectrum of ADAS/AD functionality\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ranging from Level 1, to active safety with conditional automation (Level 2/2+), to fully autonomous driving systems (Level 4). Qualcomm is offering SoC platforms built on 5nm process technology, opening the door to both standalone and customization opportunities. Snapdragon Ride now scales from 10 tera operations per second (TOPS) for windshield-mount ADAS cameras in a sub-5W power budget to over 700 TOPS for fully automated driving, the company claimed. Duggal said that samples of 5nm SoCs (available both for ADAS and digital cockpit) were in the hands of \u00e2\u0080\u009csome OEMs\u00e2\u0080\u009d since late last year. Broader sampling will start this spring, he added. Asked when chips go into mass production, Duggal noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEarliest customers that we are talking about are actually 2023, but probably more typically late 2023 or early 2024.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Blurring lines between digital cockpit and ADAS As carmakers go deeper into vehicle electrification, they hope to seize \u00e2\u0080\u009can opportunity to move the car architecture from traditional combustion engine architecture to an electric vehicle skateboard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duggal. As they depart from legacy systems, they are embracing a new Electrical/Electronics (E/E) architecture. Click the image to enlarge: (Source: Qualcomm) Gone are the days of adding a discrete MCU to enable a specific feature at a specific end point. The auto industry is already forsaking an overload of discrete MCUs for an architecture run by domain controllers. Some vendors are looking at a zonal approach. Carmakers will eventually transition towards \u00e2\u0080\u009ccentral compute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Duggal noted during his keynote. In our interview, Duggal said that central compute domains \u00e2\u0080\u009care now running on an SoC fabric.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He described it as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca universal, safety-grade fabric.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As a result, building blocks inside an SoC for ADAS or in a digital cockpit share a lot in common. Both SoCs support a GPU (or multi-core GPUs), many DSPs and accelerators, explained Duggal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, you put a software scaffold on top,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis starts with a hypervisor, supporting multiple containers, multiple virtualized partitions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, where to run which software or app is up to each carmaker. For example, a car OEM might be running DMS on the digital cockpit but later decides to move the DMS on ADAS SoC running a L2+ system. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can support that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duggal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening is that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe line is getting blurred between the application and the domain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Duggal observed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo allow that line to be blurred and still be able to have a consistent architecture, you need that common hardware fabric underneath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d How will Qualcomm win? By teaming with many partners, from Veoneer to GM, Qualcomm is in the automotive market to win. Acknowledging that the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest mobile chip vendor was never the first to enter, let alone, dominate the automotive sector, Duggal cited examples in various industries. Qualcomm never thought it impossible to pry open an ADAS market apparently cornered by Mobileye. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Mobileye is a fantastic company. I think they have done a tremendous job in computer vision and now in AI and they\u2019ve solved very complicated problems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. While crediting Mobileye, Duggal noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe way we think about it is that technology is democratic. Of all these solutions we are talking about today, there is nothing here that I can say that this is something that is an unsolvable problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Duggal went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe understand the problem, we know what it takes to solve it and we also understand the time constraints within which the problem must be solved. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we partner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A second imperative is to understand what customers need. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur customers, especially in the automotive space, like choices. They don\u2019t like to be locked down into just one solution. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first thing I\u2019ve learned in the automotive business. You watch all the choices your customers have and make sure that you are choice number one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Finally, perhaps more important, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the case of the ADAS opportunity, automakers want something that they can ultimately be responsible for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed Duggal. As more cars get automated, liability issues nag at carmakers. Duggal said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either the driver/the owner of the vehicle or the car manufacturer who will be ultimately responsible for safety and security of the car. No third party will be coming in to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to take responsibility.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d In this light, transparency becomes essential, Duggal said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarmakers have to know what they are putting into their vehicles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As EE Times understands it, the auto industry sees that any solution inside black box is a sealed coffin.
