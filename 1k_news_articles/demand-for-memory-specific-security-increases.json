The recently discovered Thunderbolt vulnerabilities by a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student from Eindhoven University of Technology, along with his supervisors, is a reminder why vendors are not only looking at how to bolster the security of interconnects, but also memory devices through bigger systems with their own security capabilities. But just as critical is the threat modeling of the original design, according to Rob Wood, Technical VP, Hardware and Embedded Security Services at NCC Group. The potential for attackers to gain access to data in a stolen laptop, for example, is high because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not considering how easy it can be to quickly tamper with the contents of flash memory using inexpensive equipment, he said. Mix in hardware interfaces that allow direct access to a computer\u2019s memory, as well as misconfigured hosts that make it easy to capture data from computers using external devices, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a recipe for even more security risks. Wood said most computers manufactured recently don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the required default configurations to make these types of attacks more difficult to carry out. The threat model for a server attached to the Internet is clear, the deeper you dive into the system, the more you need to draw boundaries around individual components around the circuit board. At this level, he said, there tends to be no authentication, encryption, or integrity protection. Security at this level never used to be all that necessary, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re no longer just putting servers behind our own locked doors, said Wood. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going into other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data centers thanks to cloud adoption, and more devices are being deployed at the edge. The threat model is a lot less clear because you have a complicated server that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of network and storage controllers, management controllers, processors and memory that each represent an attack surface. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll these systems are running firmware. These are all individual computers doing their thing, and all of them of course are attackable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The connected car is often called a server on wheels that not only requires security for memory devices holding data but must also meet functional safety requirements. (Source: Infineon) Part of the problem is that firmware down at this level is written by hardware developers, not software developers, said Wood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir motivations and security expectations are a bit different.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The firmware is designed to make the chip go, but the OEM is expected to take a firmware reference and then reimplement it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complex ecosystem with many companies that own the security problem, and because the lead time on some of the parts can be years, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already behind the times security-wise by the time they hit the market. NCC Group assesses server security from the bottom up, said Wood, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of recent research around silicon issues. One of the biggest problems, however, is that two ends of a protocol are often implemented by the same developer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNaturally they trust themselves, so they make a lot of assumptions about what the other end of that protocol is doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But if an attacker can get between them, he said, they can violate a lot of those assumptions, which is why the threat boundaries need to be drawn around the individual embedded systems. Networking vendors responsible for the interconnects are ramping up their efforts to embed security in their respective devices, as are memory makers, which aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just looking at servers, but the all the other devices in rapidly emerging markets. Infineon Technologies recently expanded the Semper NOR Flash memory platform it acquired as part of Cypress Semiconductor with Semper Secure NOR Flash, designed to meet the security, safety, and reliability requirements for connected industrial, automotive, and communications systems. In the same way that servers are full of interconnected devices, every system will eventually be connected, said Sandeep Krishnegowda, senior director of marketing and applications, memory solutions at Infineon. There are always going to be those who want to tamper with the content of a flash device, so security must be integrated inside.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
