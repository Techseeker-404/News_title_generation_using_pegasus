The fresh and innovative format of the book, \u201cAspencore Guide to Sensors in Automotive,\u201d seamlessly blends journalistic narrative, top expert input and market analysis to provide an accessible and focused account of the AV industry. Sensors in Automotive often reads like a frank conversation you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have over coffee at one of the many top-notch conferences. The information is distilled from conferences like CES, Auto Sense, or ISSCC. This is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the Guide: its informal, direct access to leading experts in AV, such as Phil Koopman and Phil Magney. SPONSORED | Learn how to enable asynchronous motor commutation with a multi-purpose Hall-effect speed sensor They hit the big questions, like how to bridge the chasm between ADAS and AVs and how safe is safe enough. The example of a child running onto the street chasing a ball came up on multiple occasions: where the technology needs to do better (with a sobering discussion of the stats on AEB-P performance); the prediction challenges for AVs (and the difficulty in getting these to match human performance, and then proving that is the case), and the holy grail of public acceptance (requiring performance that is 10x better than human performance). We get an inside view to the development of the key standards that are shaping how we think about AV safety in the years to come: from the background to UL4600 safety cases; to tracing the work of Intel Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RSS on driving policy to IEEE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emerging SOTIF; or the work of industry-led SaFAD white paper on safety is shaping ISO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Draft Technology Report (DTR) 4804. Sensors in Automotive shares specific and interesting details about how different players are approaching the AV challenge: from how many cameras Waymo vs Tesla may use, to reviewing BMW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scalable AV platform. It was great to see a discussion of precision maps and the regulatory challenges they pose, an often neglected topic. True to its name, Sensors in Automotive provides a guide to the kaleidoscopic range of sensors that are making AVs a reality. It goes much beyond the usual camera, radar, lidar trilogy exposing the nuance within these categories, such as SWIR and thermal cameras, imaging radar and various types of lidar. This is an invaluable guide to AVs, helping to articulate the questions that really matter. It gives readers the tools to better evaluate claims and predictions, and inspiration to contribute to the solutions!  \u00a0 The author is Jessica Uguccioni, Automated Vehicle Review, Lead Lawyer, at Law Commission of England and Wales.  \u00a0 \u00a0  A new book, AspenCore Guide to Sensors in Automotive: Making Cars See and Think Ahead, with contributions from leading thinkers in the safety and automotive industries, heralds the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress and identifies the engineering community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remaining challenges.
