With the microfluidics segment, driven by healthcare applications, projected to hit $4 billion by 2020, the need for defense measures is growing more acute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe attack surface is massive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said by\u00c2\u00a0Ramesh Karri, professor of electrical and computer engineering at NYU, one of the organizers of the\u00c2\u00a0Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Biochips. The August event, co-sponsored by U.S. Army Research Office (ARO), was one of the first conferences to examine biochip security. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have methods in place to secure software and wireless. The challenge is how to secure biology, fluidics, and chemistry and how can electronics interface in a secure way \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is the problem right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Karri, who is also co-chair and co-founder the university\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cybersecurity center. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of the plan of our research was to hold a workshop and create community. It started with two people with one small grant. and the idea was that we would invite like-minded researchers from different communities like computing microfluidics and biology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Krishnendu Chakrabarty, chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke and one of the organizers of the event. Presenters at the conference explored threats to digital microfluidics, an electronics process using Pacman-like manipulations of microscopic drops of fluid in tiny capillaries etched on silicon chips.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very diverse application area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d predicted Yuksel Temiz, a researcher at IBM Research Zurich. A counterfeiter can simply manipulate pregnancy tests by using the original container and substituting in a new test fabric, he noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have heard stories about people cleaning and repackaging a previously used test\u2013you can find these on Alibaba or eBay, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost impossible to know if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genuine or counterfeit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. IBM is working on security codes implemented inside the assay, not just on the package. These dynamic codes are altered by the sample itself because the codes are written in water-soluble ink, he added. William Grover\u00c2\u00a0of the University of California in Riverside described his innovation for securing an electric to non-electric interface. It uses a set of microscopic pumps on a chip to create non-electric computers, using pneumatic logic in valves to detect errors. Baebies Inc. (Durham, North Carolina) builds compact digital microfluidic platforms for near-patient diagnostics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur bottom line is providing trusted screening for infants. Incorporating safeguards against malicious manipulation is important to that goal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Scott Norton, a senior director of advanced technology for the company. NYU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tandon School of Engineering, ARO, and Duke are collaborating on securing benchtop chemistry for whole blood bioassays using embedded strands of DNA.\u00c2\u00a0A double-stranded piece of DNA serves as a macro-molecular barcode, and another strand of genetic material matching the DNA serves as the key, or primer, explained Kristin Scott, a research professor at Duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical school. She described a system in which DNA segments acting as the equivalent of organic barcodes could be injected into the sample, sealed in a solution along with the sample itself. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe barcode does not alter the sample, it just goes along for the ride. When it gets to the lab whoever is doing the research has a list of unique primers for each sample,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. A presenter from Santa Clara University discussed microfluidics for mechanical sensing and actuation in bio-medicine. An NYU speaker proposed \u00c2\u00a0a security approach for organ-on-a-chip technology. In addition, a presenter from Boston University explored ways of securing microfluidics in synthetic biology. \u2013Karl Greenberg  is a media relations officer at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
