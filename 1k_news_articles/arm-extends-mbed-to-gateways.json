Mbed Edge marks a step deeper into IoT software and services for the company known for its processor cores. The efforts serves ARM in three ways. It enhances the features of its underlying processors, sharpens its competitive edge against the rival x86 which is strong in gateways and it expands a nascent service business supplying secure keys. The first Mbed Edge product is a protocol translation module that will be previewed before the end of the year. Other modules are expected to enable secure boot, over-the-air software updates and secure certificate authorization. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gateway needs to be managed and used to its full potential\u00e2\u0080\u00a6for different workloads and data extraction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dipesh Patel, president of ARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IoT services group, in a keynote at ARM Tech Con here. The software and help integrating it into existing OEM stacks is free. However, ARM will charge for a services such as providing secure keys. It also will support hybrid software stacks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe see heterogenous topologies, gateways and processors\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reality today and how it will be for some time, so this software can be ported to and run on variety of gateways,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Horne, vice president of marketing and sales in ARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IoT group. Mbed Edge is an expansion of ARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mbed OS, a real-time operating system for IoT end nodes launched in October 2014. Mbed OS deployments have been \u00e2\u0080\u009cramping very quickly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6especially in China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Horne, declining to give numbers.  The expanding set of Mbed modules will be available to integrate into other OSes such as FreeRTOS. However, ARM aims to provide its own tested stack as a preferred solution. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany RTOSes are just kernels, but you need more than a kernel to create a complete solution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patel, noting ARM will provide and maintain a suite of integrated security and comms modules. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken all that [software support] burden away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the OEM, he said. Last year, ARM extended Mbed to include modules to link end nodes to cloud services. Mbed Edge marks an expansion of both the cloud effort and a new security architecture announced on Monday. Several analysts asked how ARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security architecture maps to efforts from Intel and standards groups. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe see people making the same [security] mistakes repeatedly, so we are offering them something they can use,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mark Muller, ARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief technologist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDifferent platforms will be built in different ways, we are not heading toward one way of doing it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Muller acknowledged higher level standards will emerge for IoT like the Common Criteria for smart cards. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will be in compliance with those standards but [their formation] will play out over quite a few years\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be horribly fragmented for some time to come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times  Related posts:  ARM Boosts IoT Security ARM Extends Into IoT Software IoT Security Spending to Skyrocket ARM Does IoT Security Chip to Cloud      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
