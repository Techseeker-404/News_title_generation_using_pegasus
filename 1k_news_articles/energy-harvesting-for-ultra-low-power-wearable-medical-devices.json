An increasing number will have requirements for greater battery power or longer battery life, but will not support bigger batteries. Some wearables, for example, might be medical implants; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not likely a bulky battery will be an option for such devices. Battery technology is keeping up by making use of energy harvesting. Energy harvesting can be an incredible advantage for devices with a small form factor, such as those that proliferate in the internet of Things (IoT). These small devices often only require tiny amounts of current, and energy harvesting from various sources can be a valuable design element. Wearable Medical Solutions Wearable devices for medical use are wearable devices that can detect, store, and transmit vital parameters (such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate) measured in real time to report the overcoming of certain critical thresholds. According to the analysis by Frost & Sullivan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u201cWearable Technologies in Clinical and Consumer Health\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 the global market for wearable devices in the medical field will reach $18.9 billion in 2020. Energy harvesting solutions have been designed as an auxiliary power source for batteries or as an independent source for the permanent use of wearable devices without restrictions associated with energy consumption. Energy harvesting is considered an unreliable source, in the sense that the availability of energy can vary considerably over time depending on the environmental conditions. It is possible to combine a source of energy harvesting such as vibration, heat, or solar with a rechargeable battery. Triboelectric effect Contact electrification is a process that produces surface charges on two dissimilar materials when they are contacted and separated. During this contact, each material develops a charge of opposite polarity. In recent years, there has been progress in developing systems for the triboelectric energy harvesting, called triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). These systems require a minimum of essential components: at least two layers of triboelectric material, physical separation between them, and electrodes for collecting electricity, in addition to a circuit of conditioning to maximize collection efficiency (figure 1). \u00a0 Figure 1: Conditioning circuit for the TENG; t1 is when the switch is closed (energy stored by the LC unit), t2 when the switch is open (energy released by the LC unit). \u00a0 The classic DC-DC buck converter is coupled with an AC-DC buck conversion circuit for the TENG, as shown in figure 1. Between the switch and the load resistance R, a diode D1, a serial inductor L, and a capacitor C are added in sequence. The switch is used not only to maximize energy transfer but also to convert the incoming buck to the circuit. The switch can be realized by a micro-power voltage comparator with MOSFET to integrate a self-management mechanism Thermal energy The thermal energy harvesting is the process of capturing the heat that is freely available in the environment or represents the waste energy emitted by engines, human body, and other sources and puts it into use. The direct conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy can be achieved through the Seebeck effect, in which a heat flow induced through an appropriately designed thermoelectric device produces a voltage and an electric current. The pair PN, which is the fundamental component of a thermoelectric generator (TEG), comprises a single structure of thermoelectric material of type P and N, each electrically connected in a series. By placing many PN pairs electrically and thermally in parallel, it is possible to build a typical TEG module that generates a voltage proportional to the thermal gradient. Thermoelectric or TEG power generation modules are already used in many applications, such as space ships, in which they collect the heat emitted by the decay of a supply of radioactive material. The emerging field of medical wearable electronics also offers the potential for thermoelectric energy collection by fueling devices with body heat.   Vibrational Energy Vibration energy harvesting uses the natural low-level sources associated with rotating machines such as electric motors, or the movement of the human body in order to generate the hundreds of microwatts or individual milliwatts. The piezoelectric transducers used are a subclass of asymmetric crystals. The asymmetry in the unitary cell of the material establishes the mechanism by which deforming the crystal leads to a small difference in potential. To \u201ctune\u201d the property of a piezoelectric transducer, however, it is necessary to fully understand the frequency profile of the vibrating object and find its resonance frequency. For some applications such as motors, the characteristics and resonance frequency of the vibrations can be well known. For others, obtaining sufficient understanding requires measuring the vibration of the object with an accelerometer and analyzing the frequency characteristics of the data acquired through the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to find the resonance frequency. RF Energy RF wireless energy harvesting offers a potential for longer battery life in portable devices. Electromagnetic waves come from a variety of sources such as satellite stations, GSM, and wireless internet. A radiofrequency energy harvesting system can capture and convert electromagnetic energy into a usable CC voltage. The main layout is composed of antenna and the rectifier circuit that allows converting the RF power or alternating current (CA) into a CC signal. An impedance matching network (IMN) ensures maximum power transfer between the RF source and the load. Power Management Power management is particularly important in small and wearable integrated systems, such as medical monitoring devices, object tracking systems, and other applications that require low-profile and cost-effective mobile computing solutions. The current trend is also to use supercapacitors, offering a new way to store energy based on nanotechnology. Unlike batteries, supercapacitors can recharge in seconds, and withstand virtually unlimited charge cycles. Supercapacitors have a higher energy density than standard capacitors, but a lower energy density than the standard batteries used in IoT systems (figure 2). Figure 2: BestCap \u00e2\u0080\u0093 BZ Series supercapacitor. (Source: AVX) \u00a0 \u00a0 LTC3109 is a highly integrated DC/DC converter ideal for energy harvesting from shallow input voltage sources such as TEG (thermoelectric generators) and thermopile. Its type allows operating with input voltages up to 30 mV, regardless of polarity. A storage capacitor (or battery) can also be charged to supply power when the input voltage source is not available. The shallow quiescent current and high efficiency maximize the energy harvesting available for the application (figure 3). Figure 3: Typical application of LTC3109. (Source: Analog Devices)    MAX17710 is a complete energy recharging system capable of handling poorly regulated sources, ranging from 1\u00ce\u00bcW to 100 mW. The device also includes a boost regulator circuit to charge the cell from a source starting at 0.75 V (tip). An internal regulator protects the cell from overload. The output voltages supplied to the target applications are regulated by an adjustable linear regulator with low dropout (LDO) adjustable with selectable voltages of 3.3 V, 2.3 V, or 1.8 V (figure 4). Figure 4: Simplified Operating Circuit of MAX17710. (Source: Maxim Integrated)  SPV1050 is an IC of the ST that allows charging any battery, including thin-film batteries. Power management is suitable for both photovoltaic cells and TEG collection sources, as it covers the input voltage range from 75 mV to 18 V and ensures high efficiency both in the buck-boost and boost configuration (figure 5). Figure 5: Block diagram for SPV1050.  AEM40940 is an energy management subsystem, which integrates with a rectifier that extracts AC power from ambient RF waves to simultaneously store energy into a rechargeable element and supply system with two independent regulated voltages. By using this device, the designers can extend the life of a broad range of wearables applications (figure 6). Figure 6: Circuit layout of AEM40940. (Source: E-Peas Semiconductors)  The AEM40940 collects the available input power up to 10 dBm and integrates an ultra-low power rectifier combined with a boost converter. The configuration pins determine various operating modes by setting the pre-defined conditions of the storage element. Conclusion The energy harvesting from various sources will be used to charge a supercapacitor and/or a rechargeable/film battery that can therefore act as a constant energy source for the load. However, the energy harvesting available as AC or DC voltages must be converted to appropriate DC levels for analog and digital components. One of the main obstacles for electronics designers has been the limited choice of available energy storage technologies. Microelectronic energy gathering is opening up new application areas with a strong impact on IoT developments.      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
