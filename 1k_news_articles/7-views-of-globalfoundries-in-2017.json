Analysts applauded the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing capabilities but said that it mainly needs to deliver in the next 12 months a competitive 7-nm process and show a volume market for fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI). \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had anticipated FD-SOI revenue this quarter, but it looks like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little delayed \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if it slips to Q4, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK, but if it runs well into 2018, it could indicate a problem getting customers to adopt a technology that may have been overhyped,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Len Jelinek, chief fab analyst for IHS Markit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have big plans for that technology in their Dresden and China fabs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m waiting to see if they hit their plans for execution on 7 nm. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first leading-edge process they are developing on their own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nathan Brookwood of market watcher Insight64, noting that the company licensed its 14-nm process from Samsung. Globalfoundries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chief technologist, Gary Patton, said that those are, indeed, his two top priorities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are very focused on our [FD-SOI] road map, both on the technology and the enablement for its body bias capability, and as for 7 nm, it is an extreme sport with tight process windows that will benefit from EUV,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patton in a press Q&A.  GF compared its high-end logic processes. Click to enlarge. (Images: Globalfoundries) GF will start before June risk production of a 7-nm node using only immersion steppers doing \u00e2\u0080\u009csome quad and quite a few triple-patterning\u00e2\u0080\u009d layers, said Patton. It targets 60% greater density and 40% more performance than its 14-nm process and acks up to 17 million gates/mm2. The foundry expects to phase in EUV in early 2019, initially just for vias and contacts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy money is on 2020 for full use of EUV,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patton. The big challenges still ahead are in finding a balance of performance and throughput for resists and getting defects out of masks. EUV mask yields are about 65% compared to 95% for all masks. Protective pellicles currently block 30% of the EUV light and need to get down to less than 10% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and none can currently withstand the projected 250-W EUV light source. The good news is that FinFETs will still be useful for \u00e2\u0080\u009cone node beyond 7 nm, and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to have something like nanowires,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patton. The GF event came one week after TSMC gave an update on its road map. Next page: Driving FD-SOI toward mainstream markets     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
