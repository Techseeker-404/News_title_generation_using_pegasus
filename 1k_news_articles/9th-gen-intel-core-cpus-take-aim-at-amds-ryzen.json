At a New York City event that was webcasted globally, Intel also provided more details on its new Core X-series high-performance processors for content creators such as animators and provided updates on its 28-core Xeon workstation chip for compute-intensive workloads. The success of Ryzen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 combined with Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stumbles in moving to 10 nm into production \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has enabled AMD to grow its processor market share from less than 10% to what some analysts say could be 25% to 30% over the next few years. According to Kevin Krewell, principal analyst with Tirias Research, Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 9th Generation Intel Core launch was a direct response to pressure being applied by AMD. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntel came out fighting, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s game on between AMD and Intel again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Krewell in an email exchange with EE Times late Monday. The flagship product in the 9th Gen Core lineup is the i9-9900K, which is priced at $488, similar to AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ryzen 7 2700X. Krewell said that the processor was \u00e2\u0080\u009cclearly priced to be competitive with AMD.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout AMD, Intel could have priced the part over $1,000.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The i9-9900K processor, features eight cores and 16 threads and can run at a frequency of up to 5 GHz. The comparable Ryzen 7 2700X also boasts eight cores and 16 threads, but its top clock speed is only 4.3 GHz. However, Krewell said that the base clock speeds are very similar: 3.6 GHz for the i9-9900K to 3.7 GHz for the Ryzen 7 2700X. Nevertheless, Intel claims that the i9-9900K bests Ryzen on in-game performance benchmarks. Anand Srivatsa, vice president and general manager for desktop, systems, and channel within Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Client Computing Group, said during a keynote address at the New York event that Intel tested the i9-9900K against previous Intel products and competing processors across 19 of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most popular games spanning all major game genres and showed it to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best gaming processor in the world, period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Anand Srivatsa, vice president and general manager for desktop, systems, and channel within Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Client Computing Group, delivering a keynote address at Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch event on Monday.
