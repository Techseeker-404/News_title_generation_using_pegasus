From designers to business managers, AspenCore\u2019s audiences will get task-specific insights and guidance for understanding technology and business issues, provided in a collection of cross-linked articles across the international AspenCore network in publications such as EE Times, EDN, Electronic Products, Embedded.com, EBN, EPS (Electronics Purchasing Strategies) News, and others. Each of our Special Projects features an anchor story in a key publication with links to articles in other publications that supplement and expand on the themes of the anchor story. In coming months, we plan to cover a variety of topics, ranging from \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutomotive Safety\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI in embedded systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeterogeneous Integration Roadmap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecurity of Industrial IoT,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cProfessional Pi\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho Will Nail the Industrial Market?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is our landing page for the past and present Special Projects:  Engineering a Solution to the IP&E ShortageSupply challenges are not something that designers typically concern themselves with, but this is one time when they should.  The Day When the Industrial IoT Gets HackedThe more devices that get connected to the industrial internet of things (IIoT) networks, the more that those networks get hacked and attacked.  Apple\u2019s $1 Trillion ClimbHow did Apple reached $1 trillion market cap? We look back at Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, decipher Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy to go vertical, examinine Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply chain and predict where Apple goes from here.  Mapping the Future of ElectronicsWith Moore\u2019s Law either out of gas or running on fumes, engineers and chip firms are increasingly eyeing the concept of heterogeneous integration as the electronics productivity driver of the future.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0  Where Would Apple be Without Taiwan?Without Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., it\u2019s hard to imagine how Apple\u2019s iPhones could have so quickly reached so many consumers around the world.   Where Did Qualcomm Go Wrong?China scuttled Qualcomm\u2019s $44 billion bid for NXP, as CEO Steve Mollenkopf framed it. But were Qualcomm missteps and misreading of the competitive environment also responsible for the fiasco?  One Man\u2019s Quest for a TeslaMy neighbor plunked down his $1,000 deposit on a Model 3 the day after Tesla began taking orders, April 1, 2016. Two years and three months later, he finally took delivery of his Tesla. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy.  Uber Fatality Sends AVs Back to Safety 101In the wake of the Uber self-driving fatality in Arizona, safety experts are urgently advising tech and automotive companies to push the reset button. The industry discussion about the \u00e2\u0080\u009csafety\u00e2\u0080\u009d of AVs and, inevitably, safety standards is overdue.  Focus on TaiwanThis Special Project examines Taiwan\u2019s potential and explores the plots its visionaries are hatching for Taiwan\u2019s next-generation engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs.  AI Flood Drives Chips to the Edge Virtually every embedded processor vendor has a product or is working on one for accelerating deep-learning tasks on client systems at the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge.\u00c2\u00a0  Four Technologies Helping Drive Industry 4.0Four technologies gaining momentum in the drive to Industry 4.0.
