A new solution from Synaptics and ID R&D offers AI-powered voice biometrics and anti-spoofing algorithms that can run on a Synaptics SoC in the edge device. Specifically, the software has been optimized for the neural processing unit (NPU) in Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 VS600 series for smart home devices such as set-top boxes (STBs), smart speakers and security systems. Synaptics sells its AI-capable SoCs into smart home products which need to process video streaming, audio streaming and imaging. A typical use case might be a STB incorporating cameras for video conferencing, for example. Voice biometrics is now accurate enough to enable payment authentication in smart home devices \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u2019s common across the set top box application and becoming more common as time goes on is the ability to use voice as an interface,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vineet Ganju, vice president of marketing at Synaptics told EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemote controls can be voice enabled so you can talk into it to navigate your Netflix account and search for movies\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 voice as an interface is almost becoming standard in these applications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When a STB runs Netflix, the first thing users have to do is select whose profile to use. With voice biometrics, the STB would know immediately who was watching, cutting a step from the process. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, with pay-per-view content, you could not only search via voice and find certain movies that maybe are not part of your subscription, but you\u2019re willing to pay $5 to watch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ganju said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen [operators] want to be able to immediately authenticate and have you purchase that movie on the spot. They see that as a huge reduction in friction, helping users not only in finding content that\u2019s personalized to them, but also being able to pay for that content and be able to watch it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On-device enrollment ID R&D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice biometrics AI extracts more than 400 features from the voice, including combinations of parameters related to frequency/pitch and other things such as pronunciation and accents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not limited the way some of the earlier generation of voice biometrics were,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Amein, senior vice president of sales at ID R&D told EE Times, adding that it is only in the last year or so that AI voice biometrics has achieved the accuracy required for applications like payment authentication. The algorithm learns to recognize the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice through a process called \u00e2\u0080\u009cenrollment\u00e2\u0080\u009d during which the user repeats a phrase three times. Any phrase can be used, and it works on any language out of the box. Enrollment is processed on the edge device. ID R&D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI algorithm can identify enrolled users with a false acceptance rate below 1 in 10,000, which Amein compares to the odds of someone guessing your PIN. The false reject rate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rate at which the enrolled user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice is erroneously rejected \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is close to 5%. And the spoof acceptance rate (SAR), for spoofing attacks such as recordings of the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice played to the system, is better than 7%, which is the standard limit for biometric unlocking of Android devices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween the biometric matching being at a false accept rate of one in 10,000 and the anti spoofing being better than the 7% rate required by the Android standard, we\u2019re really hitting both of the things that are necessary for voice biometrics to be accepted as secure enough for a payment authorization,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amein said. Anti-spoofing ID R&D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anti-spoofing technology also relies on AI. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpoken voice has a bandwidth that goes up to 3500 Hz, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sampling at a much higher rate than that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amein said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing frequencies higher than the spoken voice. We listen in these higher ranges for different characteristics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Human voice created by speaking through our tubular vocal tract produces characteristic frequencies which are very different to sounds produced by the vibration of a flat surface such as in a loudspeaker. This is one of the elements the anti-spoofing AI uses to distinguish a live voice from a recording. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also can detect synthesized voices, such as text to speech applications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amein said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of those aren\u2019t that great, but they\u2019re getting more and more lifelike. And in that scenario, there are still anomalies in the signal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u2019s too perfect in some cases, or there\u2019ll be just transitions or phase differences that the ear can\u2019t hear, but the [AI] can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Neural processing unit Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 VS600-series SoCs feature a neural processing unit (NPU); the VS680\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NPU offers 6.75 TOPS while the newly announced VS640 offers 1 TOPS and is aimed at \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore mainstream costing and performance and power points,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Vineet Ganju. Either part\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NPU has \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore than enough\u00e2\u0080\u009d compute to run ID R&D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice biometrics algorithms and anti-spoofing simultaneously, he said. The NPU was able to speed up voice biometrics inference by a factor of 10 compared to using the chip\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CPU, whose utilization was reduced by a factor of 3. Synaptics provides a toolset to allow companies like ID R&D to optimize their technologies for the NPU, and while ID R&D is Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first partner in this regard, the company will work with more partners in future for applications outside of voice biometrics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBased on our discussions with speech recognition companies, we can actually do a full English language vocabulary speech recognition engine on the device, well within the 1 TOPS capability of the NPU,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ganju said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you can have a fully offline product with regards to speech recognition\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for example, for products where users don\u2019t connect it to their WiFi right away, the onboard speech recognition can help them get a good out of the box experience even before it\u2019s connected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The first software build from ID R&D will be available on Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 VS600 development kits later this month.
