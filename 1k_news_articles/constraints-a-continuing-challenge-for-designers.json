{"Author": "EETimes\u00a0", "Date": "12.11.2017", "Keywords": "", "Article": " Over the last decade the size and complexity of FPGA designs have continued to grow for many market applications, mainly due to the additional functionality and increased performance and size of FPGA devices.\u00c2\u00a0 Considering this, FPGA designers must take into account the multiple IP sources, code reuse, and the associated design constraints for synthesis and forward annotated vendor specific place and route constraints.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 FPGA designers are continuously being pushed to accelerate schedules and reduce their development costs giving rise to more licensed IP cores in designs and more in-house design code reuse.\u00c2\u00a0 It is critical that the synthesis tools can handle various sources of IP, including their constraints (see Figure 1).  Once a project is setup, designers need to create their initial design constraints and import IP specific constraints. There are several types of constraints from timing to physical, as listed below.\u00c2\u00a0 Timing constraints o\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Declaring clocks o\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Declaring clock groups o\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Defining multicycle paths and false-paths Physical constraints and attributes o\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 IO location constraints o\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Attributes for functional safety o\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Fanout o\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Mapping control for memories, DSPs By adding the full set of constraints to synthesis, the tool can forward annotate and place and route constraints directly.\u00c2\u00a0 It is important for FPGA designers to correctly define the constraints for primary clocks for I/O, black-boxes, and generated clock nets.\u00c2\u00a0 A common mistake designers make is over constraining their design, which can put an extra burden on synthesis and directly impact achievable speed, area, and runtime for their design. Alternatively, better constraints can translate to a better input netlist for the vendor specific place and route tools, but can also cause additional runtime and congestion issues.\u00c2\u00a0 With the widely-expanding capabilities and capacities of FPGAs, implementing FPGAs is not always a push-button process. Commercial tools can help to address congestion areas; however, it is important to first understand what is causing the congestion problems.\u00c2\u00a0 Problems can arise from high resource utilization, aggressive timing constraints, placement, logic packing, and high interconnectivity among other causes.\u00c2\u00a0 In many cases, more than one congestion reducing technique is needed to successfully route a challenging design. If using Synplify (the tool Synopsys makes), designers should check the log file for an early congestion estimate. The place and route logs provide critical warnings about sub-optimal placements (clock buffers, gated clocks, etc.), as well as information about estimated congestion in placer and any initial congestion in router. FPGAs are attractive as a platform processing solution in product implementation due to their high processing bandwidth, scalability, and versatility for many applications. While the ability to integrate many sub-systems into a single FPGA is overall beneficial, it can be more challenging to apply the correct constraints and to get the design through from RTL to bitstream. A commercial tool, such as Synplify, can enable designers to define the initial constraints, tune them for the design, and help identify bottlenecks that may cause congestion issues in the flow.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0094Joe Mallett is a senior product marketing manager for FPGA-based synthesis software tools at Synopsys.
