A paper on the topic, published in the scientific journal Carbon, shows the structure of a new carbon allotrope, protomene, which researchers say offers promise of tremendous advancements in the electronics industry as a single material.\u00c2\u00a0 A team of international experts working on this advancement is led by Emirati brothers, Mohamed and Rashed Al Fahim at Alfields LLC. It is part of the United Arab Emirates government strategy to address innovation and future technologies needs for the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution,\u201d launched in September 2017. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProtomene and its tremendous properties have been on the wish lists of forward thinking innovators and manufacturers for decades, and we will deliver it,\u201d said Larry Burchfield, an American nuclear chemist who serves as chief science officer at Alfields. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u201cWe've graduated from the 'pipe dream' stage to eventually making a certain and beneficial impact upon the world of semiconductors, opto-electronics, coatings, and energy conservation,\u201d Burchfield said. Alfields says this probably marks the first new carbon allotrope classification since that of fullerenes by Nobel Laureates Robert F. Curl Jr., Sir Harold W. Krotoand Richard E. Smalley in 1996, and the most significant advancement since graphene by Nobel Laureates Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov in 2010. Work toward the actual manufacturing of protomene will move forward in collaboration with the Khalifa University of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi. Protomene qualifies as a new potentially useful direct gap semiconductor. The energy band gap is very close to that of GaN, which is approximately 3.4 eV at room temperature. As a result, protomene possesses similar semiconducting properties to GaN, which may enable it to have applications for high-power and/or high-frequency electronic devices with large breakdown voltages.

Right: the density of electronic states of these bands.Source: Carbon  Considering that it is a binary system, the control of GaN composition is challenging during the crystal growth, whereas protomene is a single-element carbon allotrope and defect control might be easier than for GaN. Due to the gap amplitude near the blue end of the visible spectrum, protomene may find applications in opto-electronic components, such as blue or UV-light generating LEDs, or as a UV filter in optics. Furthermore, the well-defined direct gap suggests that protomene may have more application in semiconductor devices than CNTs and graphene in terms of energy band gap. Indeed, one obstacle to overcome in the fabrication of CNTs is controlling whether the CNT is metallic and semiconducting. Protomene instead is predicted to be semiconducting up to a transition temperature. NEXT PAGE: Quest for New Allotropes\u00c2\u00a0  "}
