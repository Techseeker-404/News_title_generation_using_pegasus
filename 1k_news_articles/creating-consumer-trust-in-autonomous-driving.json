The Arm Cortex-A65AE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 formerly known as Helios-AE on the company's product roadmap \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is optimized for 7nm and includes integrated safety for handling sensor data in autonomous vehicles and integrated in-vehicle infotainment systems. Its introduction is billed by the company as part of a strategy for helping to improve consumer trust in autonomotive driving safety. . Lakshmi Mandyam, Arm's vice president of automotive, said in an interview with EE Times, that a major challenge in the era of autonomous vehicle is delivering the high-throughput computing required in a way that also ensures safety. Citing a 2018 survey by the American Automobile Association, Mandyam said 73% of U.S. adults are afraid to ride in a fully autonomous vehicle and 63% of U.S. adults would feel less safe sharing the road with autonomous vehicles. According to Mandyam, this gap in consumer trust around safety is one of the biggest obstacles to the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles. With the increase in sensors needed for autonomous driving comes a corresponding jump in the amount of high-throughput computing required to process the data collected, she said. \u201cWe are really focused on deploying trusted user experiences and enabling safe automotive applications,\u201d Mandyam said.  Recommended  Arm Targets Next-Level Autonomy Safety   The Cortex-A65AE is not only optimized for high-throughput workloads, it also simplifies the integration of heterogeneous processing, according to Arm. Mike Demler, a senior analyst at the Linley Group, told EE Times that the first thing that stands out about Cortex-A65AE is its multithreading capability, supporting up to eight threads. \u201cMultithreading has been a differentiation for MIPS CPUs, which is perhaps the biggest reason Mobileye uses MIPS in their EyeQ processors,\u201d Demler said. \u201cMultithreading gives greater area and power efficiency than multicore. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for the <5W rearview-mirror mounted applications Mobileye focused on.\" Source: Arm  Demler said the Cortex-A65AE delivers up to 3.5 times the performance of Arm's Cortex-A53. \u201cArm didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disclose area, but then we would expect an eight-thread Cortex-A65AE design to be smaller than a Cortex-A53 MP4,\u201d Demler said. \u201cBut the A65 also supports split-lock, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more flexible. Bottom line: it offers a replacement for MIPS Warrior I6500 in automotive applications.\u201d Split-lock enables a processor to switch between split mode for highest multicore performance or lock mode for safety for advanced multicore fault-tolerance. When the processor is in lock mode, two processor cores are locked together, performing the safe instruction, with each operation check against the other. The split-lock capability also provides additional flexibility for future mixed-criticality applications, according to Arm. Split-lock capability is not specific to Arm. But, in September, when Arm kicked off its Arm Safety Ready program with the introduction of its Cortex-A76AE, the company claimed to be \u201cthe first to introduce it to a processor uniquely designed for high performance automotive applications such as autonomous drive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cortex-A65AE processors are expected to be available in 2020, Arm said.
