Artificial intelligence increasingly is on-device intelligence, complementing the Big Data and inference processing that runs in the cloud. Purely cloud-based AI processing is impractical for real-time, mission-critical applications, which \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot afford the round-trip time or rely on critical functions to operate when in variable wireless coverage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Qualcomm notes. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving are a case in point. Qualcomm believes on-device AI will transform the in-vehicle experience, and it explains how in a webinar this month. New microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based devices that provide increased performance in smaller packages are moving inertial applications for aerospace and defense into wearables and small munitions. Analog Devices and Arrow will show you how to select and implement the right MEMS gyroscope, accelerometer and inertial measurement unit for your mil/aero application. In a separate webinar, Analog Devices and Arrow will review RF technologies for 5G millimeter-wave radios. Millimeter-wave beamforming systems promise lightning-quick data and near-zero-latency voice. Learn about the implementation requirements and trade-offs that determine the best technology choices for your radio architecture. Gate-driver ICs that deploy advances such as silicon-on-insulator shift-level technology and coreless transformers for galvanic isolation give you performance options that make it easier to pick the right driver for your power switch. Infineon will review the gate drivers that complement its IGBTs and MOSFETs. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come away with insights for designing your next intelligent power module. Meanwhile, advances in wireless sensors are expanding the Internet of Things into new markets by letting developers collect data in ways not feasible with traditional, wired sensor networks. ON Semiconductor will assess the options and show you how to reduce the energy use and cost of data sensing. September\u00e2\u0080\u0099s featured white papers and application notes offer guidance on characterizing Sigfox LP-WAN devices, enabling functional safety with Semper NOR flash, keeping boards cool without breaking a sweat, refining Bluetooth 5 for IoT, and defining a new class of \u201ccrossover\u201d embedded processors that bridge the scalability/cost/performance gaps between application processors and microcontrollers.
