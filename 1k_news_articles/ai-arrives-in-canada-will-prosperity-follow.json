{"Author": "Ariella Brown\u00a0", "Date": "07.19.2017", "Keywords": "", "Article": " DeepMind, the London-based leader in artificial intelligence owned by Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parent-company Alphabet, is now reaching across the pond to Canada. On July 5, Demis Hassabis, co-founder and CEO, DeepMind announced \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe opening of DeepMind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first ever international AI research office in Edmonton, Canada, in close collaboration with the University of Alberta.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though it was announced as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst\u00e2\u0080\u009d in terms of leaving the UK home base, in reality, as Bloomberg reported in December, the company started building up \u00e2\u0080\u009ca small team\u00e2\u0080\u009d of researchers at a Google office in Mountain View, Calif. Certainly, there is a lot more fanfare for its move to Canada. In addition to contributing on the research and education end DeepMind plans to invest in programs to promote \u00e2\u0080\u009cEdmonton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth as a technology and research hub.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The funding for such programs are also coming from within Canada, as the University of Alberta reveals in its take on the news. It welcomes the DeepMind move as yet another advance toward AI research in the country, which is the goal set by \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe federal government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That federal program, which is to be run by CIFAR, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, is expected to invest $125 million (Canadian dollars) in trying to establish an AI foothold in Canada. Dr. Alan Bernstein, President and CEO of CIFAR was quoted in StartUpHereToronto saying he anticipates \u00e2\u0080\u009cenormous potential for innovation\u00e2\u0080\u009d resulting from the initiative: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeep AI is a platform technology that cuts across virtually all sectors of the economy, with the potential to improve people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives. It will help build a stronger and more innovative economy, create high value jobs, improve transportation and lead to better and more efficient health care and social services.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That makes AI sound like is capable not only of boosting productivity but of improving things all around. In reality, though, it depends where you stand. To get the point of view from someone familiar with Canadian industry, I reached out to Nigel Southway, a business productivity expert. In his view, AI by itself is not \u00e2\u0080\u009ca magic pill that is going to help Canada or any other western nation economically or gain back significant jobs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Investing in AI in this way is what he calls \u00e2\u0080\u009ca me too strategy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a way for Canada to signal that it also has tech. Southway acknowledges that AI is an essential component of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cCPS (Cyber Physical System)\u00e2\u0080\u009d that involves \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart robots\u00e2\u0080\u009d and other components that are built around machine learning. However, such systems tend to eliminate the need for humans on the jobs rather than increase employment opportunities, and new jobs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t magically open up when old ones are filled by machines. That is just the issue that David Autor and Anna Salomons at Utrecht University School explore in a 74 page paper entitled Does Productivity Growth Threaten Employment? One of the things they point out is that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmany of the new jobs generated by an increasingly automated economy do not offer a stable, sustainable standard of living.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While it is true that some \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly-paid occupations\u00e2\u0080\u009d do open up in the context of \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvancing automation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they only present opportunities for people with the requisite qualifications. What nearly 40 years of history demonstrates is that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnological progress (alongside other causes) skews the distribution of rewards increasingly towards educated elites.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That observation is consistent with Southway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point that high tech jobs are open only to \u00e2\u0080\u009ca small percentage of the population.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, in his view, this is another example of a government initiative that will fail to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbenefit the economy as whole.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As with any other technological advance, the thing to remember is that the tool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real measure of value is in its effects. Properly applied, AI does improve efficiency, but it also usually cuts out jobs. Perhaps the way forward for AI should be to consider not only the opportunities it opens for a range of industries but what opportunities it can keep open for a range of skill sets among humans.
