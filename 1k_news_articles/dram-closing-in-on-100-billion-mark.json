Market research firms IC Insights and International Business Strategies (IBS) have both in recent days issued forecasts that DRAM would eclipse $100 billion. However, while IC Insights predicts that it will happen this year, IBS forecasts it will occur in 2019. The DRAM market surged by 78% in 2017.   According to IC Insights (Scottsdale, Ariz.), DRAM sales are expected to grow by 39% this year to reach $101.6 billion. The firm predicts that DRAM will lead all categories of semiconductor devices in sales in 2018 for a second consecutive year. IC Insights forecasts that the overall chip market will grow by 15% this year.
