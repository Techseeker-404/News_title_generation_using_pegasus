Optical zoom employs camera optics (a lens) to magnify the object, while digital zoom crops and upscales the input image. Unlike optical zoom, digital zoom reduces resolution and, as a result, diminishes image quality. In recent years, mobile devices such as smartphones have become ubiquitous. Such devices typically include two compact cameras, a main rear-facing camera, and a secondary front-facing camera. Most compact cameras are designed with the traditional structure of a digital still camera \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0i.e., they comprise a lens placed on top of an image sensor. The lens focuses the incoming light to create an image of a scene on the sensor. The dimensions of these cameras are largely determined by the size of the sensor and by the size of the lens. The size of the lens is mainly defined by the focal length (f) of the lens and the desired field of view (FoV). These properties are usually tied together such that the sensor size is proportional to FoV*f. A larger focal length results in a higher zoom factor and a longer lens, which necessitates a thicker camera. As smartphone manufacturers are constantly striving to make their products thinner, a compact camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s height becomes a limiting factor. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce compact camera height to alleviate this constraint. Nonetheless, due to the above limitation, traditional compact camera performance is very limited; the severe height restriction eliminates any distinct performance enhancement \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0in particular, an optical zoom feature.  This article covers the entire evolution of zoom cameras in smartphones, from early days of the Samsung Galaxy K-zoom, through the latest iPhones and the Samsung Note8, to the future of folded zoom cameras. It also explains some of the mobile photography fundamentals and how vendors strike a fine balance between them. Traditional Smartphone Cameras The common single compact digital camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s structure includes a fixed focal length lens placed on top of an image sensor. This allows for easier optical assembly, reduces cost and increases the assembly yield.  In spite of the clear advantages of this structure, it creates difficulties when trying to reach high zoom factors in a compact mobile camera. There are two main reasons for this:  The lens has a fixed focal length and does not produce varying zoom factors. A variable focal length solution requires a significantly higher-than-usual camera \u00e2\u0080\u009cbump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d effectively increasing the overall smartphone thickness.   The lens in most mobile cameras can move slightly in relation to the image sensor position, enabling functions such as auto focus (AF) and optical image stabilization (OIS). A voice coil motor (VCM) is the dominant actuator technology for moving the lens in mobile cameras. The first generation of actuators allows AF only, moving the lens along the Z-axis (towards and away from the image sensor, or formally the image \u00e2\u0080\u009csensor plane\u00e2\u0080\u009d). A more advanced generation of actuators can move the lens in 3 orthogonal axes: lens movement along the Z-axis for AF, and lens movement along the sensor plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s axes (X, Y) to allow for OIS.
