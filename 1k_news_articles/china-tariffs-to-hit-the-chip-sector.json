The Trump administration on Tuesday finalized plans to implement later this month a 25% tariff on a\u00c2\u00a0list of Chinese products worth $16 billion annually. It will mark the second group of products to be hit with the tariff as part of the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an initial $34 billion worth of Chinese products have been subject to the tariff since July 6. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) trade group estimates that about $6.3 billion per year worth of semiconductors and related products are in one of the two tariff tranches, with the majority of those on the list released Tuesday. Semiconductor related items on the list Tuesday include equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, as well as diodes and other types of devices.

John Neuffer  In a statement released Tuesday, John Neuffer, the SIA's president and CEO, said the organization was \u201cdisappointed and puzzled\u201d that chips and related products remained on the list despite the industry's lobbying efforts.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 The administration initially imposed the tariffs after failing to reach agreement with China on a trade deal that would cut the bilateral trade deficit between the two countries, which was worth stood at about $375 billion last year. The administration has argued that imposing the tariffs is necessary absent a broader trade agreement that would curb Chinese policies it views as anticompetitive and better protect the intellectual property rights of U.S. firms. Both the SIA and SEMI have expressed support for the administration's aims, particularly around intellectual property correction. However, both \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like most U.S. trade groups, economists and analysts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 oppose the tariffs, which they say will ultimately harm the global economy and penalize U.S. companies and consumers.\u201d \u201cWe have made the case to the administration, in the strongest possible terms, that tariffs imposed on semiconductors imported from China will hurt America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chipmakers, not China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and will do nothing to stop China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problematic and discriminatory trade practices,\u201d Neuffer said. \u201cWe will continue to make this case and remain hopeful a sensible solution can be achieved that protects the interests of American businesses and consumers.\u201d                    Will the tariffs imposed by the Trump Administrative on Chinese products be a net positive or negative for U.S. high-tech workers?
