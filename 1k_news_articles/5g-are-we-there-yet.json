Rahim Tafazolli, director of the 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC) at the University of Surrey, was one of the speakers to place a key emphasis on this, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe business case is the biggest barrier to 5G adoption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said this in the context of the costs of enabling 5G infrastructure, such as densification, which means that we may not see wide-area service providers as with 3G and 4G rollouts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstalling millimeter-wave band everywhere would be just too expensive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. While the technical discussions at the Glasgow summit were very much along the lines of the Brooklyn 5G Summit that EE Times reported on earlier this year around aspects like network slicing and edge computing, the broad consensus in Glasgow was that there is so much more to consider, such as how infrastructure sharing, spectrum sharing, data sharing, whether high latency is even needed or can be justified in the majority of use cases in terms of both cost and complexity, and the business case. Coverage still likely to be an issue   There was also a feeling that there are misconceptions about what 5G can deliver and what issues it will solve. Yes, it might offer enhanced mobile broadband connectivity (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC), but what about things like coverage? In Scotland, for example, the University of Strathclyde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s James Irvine, who is also the IEEE 5G Summit chair, said that one of the power utilities told him recently that in the south of Scotland, because 60% of their coverage area doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have mobile connectivity, it would be impossible to roll out smart meters to everyone. Bang goes the promise of IoT there, and 5G doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solve that unless lots of new infrastructure is created. But no one will do so because there is no justifiable business case that provides a return on investment. Rural coverage was given a track of its own at the summit, given its importance in countries like Scotland. Zahid Ghadialy, a senior director of Parallel Wireless and champion for the future devices and technologies special interest group (SIG) of Cambridge Wireless, said that satellite provides the answer. He commented, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMobile operators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 philosophy has always been, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Build it and they will come.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d But rural is always left out. He suggests that satellite broadband and mega constellations are on the rise and could address this issue. Stuart Revell, who is with the 5G Innovation Center at the University of Surrey, echoed the sentiment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSatellite will come back as a key component at the end of the tail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ghadialy added that 15 companies have already declared their intent to develop LEO and MEO broadband satellites, including a Facebook company, PointView, which is reported to be planning to launch a LEO satellite using millimeter-wave radio in early 2019. Air-based cells were also a solution touted both for rural and emergency deployments. Ayan Ghosh, a collaborative trials principal at BT and affectionately known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDroneman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d architected air-based cells for rapid deployment for emergency services networks and had trialled this last year in the 26-GHz band.
