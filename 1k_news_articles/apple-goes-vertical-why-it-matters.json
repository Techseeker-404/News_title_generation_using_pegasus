To do this, I first need to think about the iPhone. It is the defining product on the road to the trillion-dollar milestone. When the iPhone was unveiled on Jan. 9, 2007, it was a departure from the existing phone paradigm. Steve Jobs described it as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communicator.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That day, he also introduced a new operating system: iPhoneOS, aka iOS. Steve Jobs quotes Alan Kay at iPhone 7 launch.  What about Alan Kay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quote above? Steve Jobs included it in the 2007 iPhone launch. At face value, it captured Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need to design its own phone, to run its new iOS software, which brought about a new way of interacting with phones \u00e2\u0080\u0094 think touchscreen, virtual keyboard, and swipes. We did not know that this quote would soon apply to Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jump into a much larger semiconductor effort. Apple was about to go vertical. Early days and the A4  Why would Apple want to bring large-scale semiconductor design in-house? It is an expensive endeavor. Would they be able to design comparable, let alone better, ICs than X or Y semiconductor company that was already in the space? Surely, it was too big a risk.  Recommended:   Apple\u2019s Trillion Dollar Fairy Tale, Warts and All   But in the spring of 2008, Apple announced the acquisition of PA Semi, a largely unknown processor design house focused on Digital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s StrongARM technology. Apple said that they wanted to further differentiate their products. Later, rumors started to emerge that Apple acquired Intrinsity, another processor designer. They were marketing their Hummingbird Arm-based CPU. This latter acquisition was confirmed in April 2010. On Jan. 27, 2010, Steve Jobs took to the stage to introduce the iPad and the Apple-designed A4 SoC. I thought about the possibly impending tablet and its silicon a week before the keynote. I thought a tablet would require silicon that is between that in the iPhone and a MacBook. I also asked \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6what happens if you could design your own processor with blocks tailored solely to your device and its application?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The A-series, and what I consider the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodern\u00e2\u0080\u009d Apple semiconductor effort, was underway. When my co-authors and I looked at the A4 for EE Times, we found considerable block level similarity with Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s S5PC110; i.e., an Arm-based SoC of the day. It was also found that the Arm CPUs were identical. Our A4 die photo from the EE Times article is shown below. The A4 did not seem to be a differentiating SoC, but there was not much time between the above acquisitions and the 2009 date code on the package in the publicity shot.
