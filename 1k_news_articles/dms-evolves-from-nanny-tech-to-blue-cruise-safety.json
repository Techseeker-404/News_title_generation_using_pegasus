{"Author": "Junko Yoshida\u00a0", "Date": "04.16.2021", "Keywords": "", "Article": " Ford Motor Company introduced its Blue Cruise, an active advanced assisted-driving system (ADAS) function that enables hands-free highway driving, but only on specified roads. Ford will roll out the feature in the third quarter of 2021 with an over-the-air update to some F-150 trucks and Mustang Mach-E crossovers. Ford\u2019s new hands-free driving system, called Blue Cruise, comes with a driver-monitoring system mounted just above the infotainment screen. (Image: Ford) Part of the significance of BlueCruise is that it exemplifies the rapidly growing importance the industry is placing on driver monitor systems (DMS). An oft-cited critical element in safety of active ADAS is DMS with eye-tracking technology. Ford\u2019s DMS is based on an infrared camera; the system is mounted just above the infotainment screen. DMS skeptics have dismissed it as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnanny tech\u00e2\u0080\u009d while proponents deem it a crucial safety advancement. Such issues were part of a panel discussion at \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoadmap to the Next-Gen EV&AV\u00e2\u0080\u009d a conference held by EE Times last month. You might be surprised to see how far DMS has evolved. The driver monitoring system (DMS), overshadowed by the hype surrounding autonomous vehicles, has been underreported and underappreciated \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially among U.S.-based carmakers and consumers. This neglect, however, is about to change, according to panelists who participated in a DMS panel at our recent conference, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoadmap to the Next-gen EV & AV.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Regulatory pressures are mounting on carmakers to adopt DMS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially in Europe and China. As more automated features \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as hands-free highway driving \u00e2\u0080\u0093 emerge, auto companies recognize DMS as paramount to keeping human drivers alert and collaborating with cars while driving. EE Times assembled leading DMS experts, including designers of DMS software and hardware, suppliers of chips and modules, a system integrator and an industry analyst. The panel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals were 1) to understand the basic science behind the technology, 2) to learn design options carmakers are exploring for DMS implementation, and 3) to discuss how companies planning to sell DMS to consumers. Nick DiFiore Nick Difiore acknowledged, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere has been a relatively slow uptake\u00e2\u0080\u009d among some OEMs and tier ones in \u00e2\u0080\u009creally understanding the human factors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Difiore is senior vice president, general manager, Automotive at Seeing Machines, one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading DMS algorithm and system developers. By \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman factors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he refers to the science of understanding and predicting human behavior in vehicles, devising the best way to help people drive safely. Despite \u00e2\u0080\u009ca bit of a slow start, interest [in DMS] is becoming really ubiquitous now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed DiFiore. The auto industry, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwants to make semi-autonomous vehicles safer and make drivers [to become] safer drivers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Caroline Chung Today, few people have DMS in their vehicles, noted Caroline Chung, senior business development manager at Veoneer. DMS-equipped vehicles are limited to \u00e2\u0080\u009cGM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Super Cruise, and only a few others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Chung sees changes afoot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince the beginning of the year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has come out with Request for Information (RFI) on DMS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This, she said, indicates that the U.S. is likely to follow Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead. Andy Hanvey Andy Hanvey, director of automotive marketing, Omnivision, concurred. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery day, I am getting more and more RFQs and RFIs [for DMS]. Almost countless\u2026 the volume is increasingly rapidly, and the demand is global.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hanvey also pointed out that many carmakers want not just DMS but also occupant monitoring systems (OMS). Safety is the key reason for DMS, but OMS also has a safety role, according to Willard Tu, senior director, Xilinx. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery year [in the United States], about 40 infants die from being left in a hot car. For the deaths of pets, you double the number.\u201d But it is the economic calculation that is driving OEMs to push both DMS and OMS. Seeing Machines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 DiFirore said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you put in an expensive driver monitoring system, the instinct [among carmakers] is to immediately start looking for how else they can leverage this for comfort or convenience features they can charge for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Willard Tu Examples for consumer-oriented applications of OMS include: \u00e2\u0080\u009ca video call in a vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u009d for business, or \u00e2\u0080\u009ca selfie mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d of OMS that automatically takes a picture of occupants with a simple voice command. This is a feature most likely popular in China, explained Xilinx\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tu. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are gimmicky,\u00e2\u0080\u009d acknowledged Tu, but carmaker should consider anything that appeals to consumers. DiFirore noted that in reality, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very hard to charge for safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the introduction of consumer-oriented OMS features could alter that dynamic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are seeing the market [for DMS and OMS] about to explode,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. DMS vs. OMS The technical differences between DMS and OMS are huge. Colin Barnden DMS is all about wanting \u00e2\u0080\u009can epic amount of information about the driver\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It probably demands 60 frames per second vision analytics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Colin Barnden, lead analyst, Semicast Research. DMS monitors not just head pose, but also eye gaze. Driver monitoring measures levels of attention, distraction, cognition to understand the drivers\u2019 attention, state and engagement level in the task of driving. Occupant monitoring is different, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are looking at, maybe five to 20 frames per second,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as OMS looks at the wider cabin and positions of the occupants, Barnden explained. Carmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desire to push both DMS and OMS into one vehicle, however, forces change in the original DMS design. The system must address \u00e2\u0080\u009cresolution of your camera from near field of view to wide field of view,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Barnden. It has to watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot just occupants in the front passenger seat but also those in the rear seats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He suspects that DMS software suppliers are \u00e2\u0080\u009creally trying to meet the needs of the automakers looking for these quite different technical requirements [by DMS and OMS]\u00e2\u0080\u009d of optical path and processing. Omnivision\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hanvey added that the traditional DMS camera is an NIR-based sensor, which is monochrome. But if consumers want to do a video conference inside a car, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must figure out a way to offer additional processing to get them the color image.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In-cabin sensing, however, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to depend on just cameras, noted Veoneer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chung. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can start talking about time-of-flight cameras in there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6or maybe even radars or thermal sensing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Owl vs. lizard The technology has evolved over time from an indirect DMS to watch the steering wheel and its rotation. Now the system primarily relies on head pose as the key to reading driver attention. Today, the latest DMS looks at driver attention based on \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman factors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 studies, and actually studies of animals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained DiFiore. Comparing an owl with a lizard, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe owl focuses on objects by turning its head. It never moves its eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In contrast, the lizard keeps its head steady while its eyes dart back and forth, as it focuses on different objects. As humans, he concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a combination of lizard and owl behavior. When we focus on objects, it\u2019s normally a combination of our eyes moving and our head moving, depending on the task and the range.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus, the latest DMS seeks to know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in a driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head by collecting an awful lot of information including eye-gaze patterns and eyelid behaviors. Veoneer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chung said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI agree with Nick [DiFiore] that the eye gaze is the future and the highest performance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But given a growing number of carmakers looking to implement DMS, she noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe it is just a head post system that\u2019s acceptable in the short term DMS for mass market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DMS on a chip? Presumably, DMS software could run on a chip designed for an infotainment system or even on a SoC designed for ADAS. Xilinx\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tu, however, believes that the use of a standalone for DMS \u00e2\u0080\u009cis probably a better way to go for the next several years\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and that\u2019s what the RFQ tends to be indicating right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There are many advantages to a standalone unit, including that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u2019s easier to do revisions or updates of DMS without having to address [how such changes might impact] a bigger domain controller.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reactive vs. Predictive As Chung noted, one of the big benefits of DMS is its ability to predict and react by understanding when drivers get distracted or drowsy. But if so, can DMS do more than issue an alarm? We asked: Why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t DMS intervene? DiFiore said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He calls it \u00e2\u0080\u009creverse of Level 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d system. In a Level 2 system in which car and driver cooperate, you can say the car is controlling the vehicle, with the driver as backup, he explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the reverse can also be true. In many cases, the car has the ability to keep itself in a lane and the car has the ability to brake when it needs to. So if the driver is in control, but is failing for whatever reason, why can\u2019t the vehicle back the driver up, instead of the driver backing the vehicle? And this is clearly going to happen, in our opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to DiFiore.  Missed our \u201cRoadmap to Next-Gen EV&AV\u201d conference?
