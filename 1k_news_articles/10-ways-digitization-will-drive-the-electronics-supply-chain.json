At the same time, the shift will bring with it the potential of growing pains as organizations revamp technology, process, and procedures in new ways. \u201cThe supply chain is undergoing almost unparalleled levels of change. The older measures, productivity, quality, and service still apply, of course, but we now see the specter of digital transformation poised to change everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Simon Ellis, program vice president, Global Supply Chain Strategies at market research firm IDC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether it\u2019s the way that manufacturers and retailers plan, procure, or fulfil, digital transformation is both opening up new opportunities and presenting new challenges.\u201d Just about every aspect of the supply chain including planning, execution/fulfillment, procurement, and security will be impacted by digitization. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the supply chain be more and more of the driver of future capabilities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ellis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy layering services on top of service, supply chains are being more efficient and more effective. A broader notion of digital transformation has taken root. Most manufacturers have a notion that they have to digitally transform to be relevant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In its recently released study titled IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Supply Chain 2018 Predictions, the company offered manufacturers and retailers 10 predictions and underlying drivers that it expects will drive the decisions that manufacturers make about IT investments in the supply chain this year and beyond. We sat down with Ellis to talk about these predictions, and especially how they might affect electronics original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), contract manufacturers, and other industry players. \u00c2\u00a0He stressed the importance of ensuring that technology is in service of business goals to achieve something, whether reliability, visibility, or cost competitiveness.
