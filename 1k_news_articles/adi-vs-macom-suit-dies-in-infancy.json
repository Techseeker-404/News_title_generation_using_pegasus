(ADI) on May 21 accusing MACOM Technology Solutions Inc. of intellectual property theft has fizzled less than two months later. The suit, which alleged that, since 2016, MACOM has launched several products similar to those by ADI after three former ADI employees left the company and started working for MACOM, was withdrawn Monday, with prejudice, according to the notice of voluntary dismissal filed in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. At the heart of the case involving the two Massachusetts-based rivals lie misappropriated trade secrets that have led to allegations of patent infringement related to two products: monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) wideband distributed amplifiers and voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). Three former ADI employees, who allegedly carried the secrets to MACOM, used to work for Hittite Microwave Corp., which was acquired by ADI in 2014. It is not clear why ADI and co-plaintiff Hittite (now a wholly owned subsidiary of ADI) suddenly decided to fold. MACOM had until July 27 to respond to the ADI charges. The first court conference was scheduled for Aug. 6. EE Times reached out to ADI and MACOM for comment, but both companies declined an interview. So was this just a frivolous gambit by ADI? We may never know. Nonetheless, the ADI versus MACOM case, despite its disappearance, opens a window to the RF/microwave world, which industry experts describe as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairly small club of vendors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The wave of M&A and consolidation within the semiconductor industry appears to affect how members treat one another. Meanwhile, competition among a shrinking number of vendors seems to have grown more cutthroat than ever. Rob Lineback, senior market research analyst at IC Insights, told us that ADI and MACOM \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefinitely go toe-to-toe in RF amplifiers, switches, and some other analog ICs in communications network gear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that they are both headquartered in the greater Boston area increases the \u00e2\u0080\u0098hometown\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rivalry between them for engineering and R&D talent as well as some RF, microwave, and analog product areas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Think BC versus BU in the Beanpot. ADI dwarfs MACOM  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note, though, that MACOM isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the same league with ADI when it comes to business size. Lineback said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnalog is about eight times the size of MACOM, in terms of annual revenue, and has nearly nine times the number of employees worldwide \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about 15,300 at ADI versus 1,800 workers at MACOM last year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More specifically, ADI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2017 sales totaled $5.8 billion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaking it the 18th largest semiconductor company in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lineback. MACOM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue was about $678 million last year.  John Croteau "}
