We propose a solution that embodies several technological trends, namely apps that assist with navigation, and the use of autonomous vehicles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in this case, wheelchairs or small trolleys. This will support many of the distancing and hygiene protocols that have been adopted during the COVID-19 epidemic, which are likely to linger after the first wave of the epidemic passes. Wheelchairs: problems with current navigation Currently, wheelchairs are the primary solution for passengers requiring assistance. This was a viable solution once but increased travel and busier airports present problems with this:  There is unavailability or insufficient availability of airport/airlines staff to take care of the passengers As compared to 2010, 66% more people with disabilities or impairment travelled in 2018 As per the latest Civil Aviation Authority figures, 62% of people who had used the special assistance service found it poor or very poor. People with language issues and/or issues in navigating an airport book assistance due to lack of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeet and assist\u00e2\u0080\u009d kind of utilities at hub airports As per an IATA (International Air Transport Association) survey of 48 airlines, demand for wheelchair assistance among visually impaired passengers grew 30% between 2016 and 2017  Proposed solution Figure 1 adds the solution for specific segments along with the targeted value proposition to airlines. Typically, it is the bright green and the dark blue segment that will benefit from the proposed solution on top of the lighter green segment, which is already served at airports:  Bright green segment (with identified but unmet needs): the ones who need assistance (identified need) but do not ask for it from airlines staff (unmet need). These are passengers who look for co-passengers in airlines queue, security counters, etc. traveling via the same flight. Dark blue segment (not comfortable with usage of new technologies): These are typically aged passengers, generally baby boomers or older.  Figure 1: Psychographic segmentation of passengers, value proposition to airlines and the proposed solution. Altogether, the top three segments are in need of assisted navigation. The three parts to the proposed solution:  Automated guided vehicles (AGV) or intelligent guided vehicles: Assistance wheelchairs at airports to have self-navigation capability by picking up the relevant data (boarding gate, time, etc. from the passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 boarding pass). A smartphone app with navigation built on top of airport internal maps: This app will use Augmented Reality to show the way for the passenger to take. Also, the same app will have a feature that will scan the surroundings to identify any other co-passengers who opted to help others with reaching their boarding gates. A basic tablet device with the same features as the app.  Assisted navigation: smart boarding pass device The airlines personnel at the airlines counter can hand over a smart boarding pass to the passenger or download an app on the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smartphone (depending on which segment the passenger falls into, passengers in the dark blue segment are generally not comfortable with switching between apps on their smartphone). The airlines personnel will enter the passenger name record (PNR) details of the passenger into the device or the UI of the app. With this, the following functions will be taken care of:  Using internal Google maps guide the passenger to the appropriate boarding gate. If the user holds out this device to the environment, certain boards/signs that are basic convenience related \u00e2\u0080\u0094 washrooms etc. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will be highlighted Physical alerts/alarms; the\u00c2\u00a0device will vibrate every time the user is going in the wrong direction When boarding begins, device vibrates with sound to alert passenger If boarding gate changes after having secured the boarding pass, a smart pass will be updated with the new info automatically. The navigation system will also change the destination as per the new info received. When holding out the device to the environment, other passengers taking the same flight will be highlighted (passengers who have signed up for assistive help to co-passengers) Language agnostic. Will have earphones that the user can use and the directions will be given in user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferred language. At security check, the passenger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smart boarding pass is digitally authenticated by biometric recognition/authentication by security personnel, such as a fingerprint swipe Need to ask passengers if they will sign up for assisted navigation for other co-passengers as indicated in point #4  AGV in airports The manually pushed wheelchairs in airports today fall short of meeting passenger expectations for a plethora of reasons. They will be replaced by an AGV that will have features from all possible scenarios, including an SOS button for intervention by airlines staff.  The airlines personnel can help the elderly with AGV carts now; helper needs will drop drastically. This cart will transport the passenger requiring assistance to the boarding gate using internal Google maps A simple wheelchair will have a retrofitted autonomous navigation system; an AGV will make the technology easier. A line follower kind of AGV can be used. An SOS button on the wheelchair can be pressed by the passenger and can be traced by the airlines staff in case any emergency help is needed. The AGV will have a button to make a detour possible en route. The AGV hand rest will have sound and vibration alerts, to notify the passenger of the boarding time There will be a backend trigger mechanism for the AGV, so airlines can provide information such as boarding gate number, using their interface The AGV is used within the airport building premises, beyond it there is a manually driven wheelchair  Business dynamics:  The adoption rates of the proposed solution depend on the perceived value by the airlines, airports, and retail vendors. There is a symbiotic relationship between airports and airlines. Some noteworthy specifics of their dependency are as follows:  Both share a common goal: getting more passengers. Ownership structure, governance, and institutional framework are all different for all airport-airlines relationships. For airports, it is about the development of the region/city, so the local government is also interested in its affairs. Airlines choose airports. Airlines are thus much more powerful today because they can change airports but airports cannot change their location. Airports also as a rule need to treat all airlines equally, same charges, etc. When actually the airlines treat each airport relationship as unique, owing to geographical variations. Symbiotic relationship; especially with international airlines which are new to a geography, airports can help with local regulations and important connects. Airports, thus, act as the link between airlines and the local help. Airports help airlines in deciding the route as well owing to sometimes their better understanding of the geography and local factors.
