But instead of covering the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on throbbing feet, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m monitoring it from my home office New York. Due to Covid-19, CES, like nearly all conventions over the past 10 months or so, is being held virtually. My feet may be happy, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not the same without the bells and whistles. The Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES, is doing what it can, using digital tools to host press conferences by marquee tech giants like LG, Samsung and Sony \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and up-and-comers to the U.S. market like TCL and Skyworth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but CE gear and gadgets need to be seen and heard, even felt, to have full impact. Samsung returned to CES with its MicroLED display technology, dubbed The Wall. After years of it being a glimpse into the future, MicroLED is supposed to hit the market this year as a TV people can actually buy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all 110 inches of it. Now that is something I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see in person, but eying it from my 22-inch computer monitor is like trying to grasp the wonder of the Segovia Aqueduct from a 6.7-inch iPhone. You have to see it IRL to truly experience it. [Click on the image for a larger view]TCL says it will have 85-inch 8K TVs in the market this year, joining LG, Samsung and others. Just when you think a TV picture is as good as it gets, along comes a new technology with better dynamic range, deeper blacks, higher contrast and more detail. After covering CES for a few decades I have those latest and greatest TV press releases down nearly verbatim. Marketing aside, I remember when I first saw HD, and it floored me. Seeing is believing, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m missing out this year on seeing 8K, the new features of NextGenTV and demonstrations of the latest game players on cutting-edge low-latency TVs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not surprising artificial intelligence is a big theme at CES 2021. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been living artificially since March, when the pandemic began to rage, pushing us away from our day-to-day office and school lives into an artificial reality where almost all our school, work and entertainment activities are enabled by electronics behind a plate of glass. LG refreshed its OLED TVs this year in the Evo line that boasts \u00e2\u0080\u009cpowerful upscaling\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep learning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A feature called AI Picture Pro uses a light sensor to measure ambient light. Then the TV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s processor adjusts tone mapping for optimal screen brightness to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransform darker scenes into ones with stunning contrast, detail, and color depth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something else I want to see for myself. There have been a lot of whizbang TV features over the years that have promised to make TV pictures \u00e2\u0080\u009camazing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetter-than-real,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreathtaking\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. A lot haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turned out that way. Take, for instance, motion smoothing, known by different marketing terms like TruMotion, Action Smoothing and Motionflow. The technology removes artifacts such as blurring from sports events using interpolation, which is good, but when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching movies, it replaces the dimensionality of film with the sharper look of a soap-opera which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good. Some TV makers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including LG, Samsung and Vizio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have adopted as an option Filmmaker Mode, jointly developed by filmmakers, studios, TV makers and UHD Alliance. The feature disables post-processing tweaks like motion smoothing and preserves correct aspect ratios, colors and frame rates. It gives you the option to strip AI out when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want it. I see that as a win-win. Other AI at CES: Samsung pushed its fitness app in press events, showing homebound consumers working out to a virtual trainer that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the Samsung Health app on premium TVs (You bring your own webcam). The trainer works with your smartphone to count reps and critique your form. The app includes workouts, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a computer checking your style: the company worked with pro trainers to create the programs. Though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m impressed by the tech, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be connecting a camera to my TV. On top of that, the robots are coming, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really not ready for that. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close enough quarters here with two adults and a couple of felines in a 750-square-foot Manhattan apartment. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no room for a Jetson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rosie, picking up glassware and emptying the dishwasher. That, apparently is Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot-too-distant future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where its AI engine rules the roost. Between Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri, I have enough AI monitoring my life. Samsung is starting small this year, bringing a robot vac bot to the U.S. IRobot launched that category a number of years ago, terrorizing cats all over the world. Now Samsung is bringing JetBot 90 AI+, which packs a camera and lots of AI. I like the idea that it can discern between a dust bunny and a USB-C cable, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not crazy about an appliance with eyes scurrying around the floor. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just the big guys making AI noise at CES. A startup called Noopl showed a smartphone accessory designed to help you hear clearly based on where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking. The Noopl device plugs into an iPhone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lightning port and has three MEMS mics that work with an app to perform audio signal processing. It works with a spatial audio feature in the AirPods Pro to track your head, reduce background noise and focus on the person you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking to. That means it knows where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking. Yeah, I dunno. Apple knows a lot more than I want it to already, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nope to Noopl. Artificial intelligence and an artificial CES. Meh. Give me the bells and whistles, Sin City and larger-than-life TV, but throw in a foot massage, too.
