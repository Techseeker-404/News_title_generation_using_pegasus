Now that it has finally come to pass, we are hit by a perfect storm on the flash die supply side. With a transition to 3D NAND running late, and high demand in all sectors from smartphones to servers, flash die supply is very tight today. Prices are rising by 20% or more and shortages in segments like PCs are impacting sales.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken a while for IT staff to accept the obvious. SSDs are a much faster solution for computer storage than spinning rust. We are talking huge factors, around 1000x or even more in performance, so you might wonder what took them so long. I guess price was an issue, though only the wise realized that a given server could do twice as much work with SSDs, saving more than any SSD premiums might cost. Still, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally recognized that \u00e2\u0080\u009centerprise\u00e2\u0080\u009d HDDs are no longer the right choice for primary storage. Further, we are on the edge of accepting that the rest of the HDD market, mainly SATA drives, are also challenged by SSDs as 3D NAND allows capacities per drive in the 30 to 100TB range.
