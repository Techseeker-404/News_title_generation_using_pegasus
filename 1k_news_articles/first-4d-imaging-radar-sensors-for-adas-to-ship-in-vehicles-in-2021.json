Continental\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new advanced radar sensor (ARS) 540 will use the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform, enabling vehicles equipped with the sensor to realize SAE J3016 Level 2 functionalities, paving the way toward eventual Level 5 autonomous driving systems. 4D imaging radar determines an object\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location in range, azimuth, elevation, and relative speed to provide detailed information about the driving environment. Earlier automotive radar systems capture only speed and azimuth. The various scenarios where radar comes in useful in automated driving (Image: Xilinx) (Click on the image for an enlarged view) Continental\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ARS540 is a long-range 4D imaging radar with high resolution and 300-meter range. Its\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00b160\u00c2\u00b0 field-of-view enables multi-hypothesis tracking for prediction while driving, which is critical for managing complex driving scenarios, such as the detection of a traffic jam under a bridge. In addition, the ARS540 system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high horizontal and vertical resolution enables detection of potentially hazardous objects on the road and responds appropriately. By supporting SAE Level 2 where the human driver is responsible for supervising vehicle control, and extending to fully autonomous Level 5, the ARS540 showcases the scalable usage of the sensor. Willard Tu Speaking to EE Times, Willard Tu, senior director of automotive at Xilinx, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven though radar technology is considered mature, there is still room for innovation. Sensors currently available operate to 100- to 150 meters, and the industry is pressing for 300 meters. Lidar technology is evolving rapidly with multiple approaches, while with cameras the resolution required for 300 meters could jump from just one megapixel to eight megapixels, which would create huge performance demands. On the other hand, 4D imaging radar can achieve the 300-meter range and take true height measurements as opposed to inferring heights. The major benefit of radar over lidar is that it is more mature and lower cost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We asked about some of the other 4D imaging radar solutions that have been announced by various startups. He responded that these are often still at proof-of-concept phase, and that no other 4D imaging radar solution is actually production-ready in a passenger vehicle. The adaptable Xilinx platform enables Continental\u2019s 4D imaging radar to be agnostic to multiple sensor-platform configurations. (Image: Xilinx) The Xilinx automotive (XA) Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC is an adaptable platform allowing Continental\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4D imaging radar to be agnostic to multiple sensor-platform configurations and adapt to OEM specification. Parallel processing within the device\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programmable logic enables the fully independent, simultaneous processing pipelines that are critical to the ARS540\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4D sensing. The many digital signal processing (DSP) slices enable hardware acceleration of real-time radar sensor inputs. The FPGA platform is the same as that used by Subaru in its Eyesight stereo vision-based advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) in its new Levorg vehicle. C\u00c3\u00a9dric Malaquin, technology & market analyst, RF devices & technology at Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement (Yole), commented, \u00e2\u0080\u009c4D imaging radar provides greater range, field of view, and perception and is a critical sensor enabling Level 2 to Level 5 developers to deliver systems that help create a safer driving environment. We expect 4D imaging radar to take place in luxury cars and robotaxis at first, leading to over US$550 million, a rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 124% between 2020 and 2025. Xilinx and Continental, two innovative market leaders have an excellent opportunity by teaming up to develop this new sensing modality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The head of program management for radar at Continental, Norbert Hammerschmidt, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform delivers the high performance and advanced DSP capabilities we needed to realize the ARS540, combined with adaptability and a market-leading selection of network interfaces capable of handling the wide array of antenna data at extremely high aggregate transfer rates. Continental recently won designs with leading European and US OEMs and is in ongoing discussions with additional OEMs worldwide regarding the ARS540. We are very proud to continue our long-standing partnership with Xilinx and to now provide the market with a technology that has the potential to save lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tu from Xilinx added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are extremely pleased to be powering the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first production-ready 4D imaging radar. The sophisticated features in Continental\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ARS540 accelerate the wider adoption of autonomous driving by bringing this advanced technology into passenger-owned vehicles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
