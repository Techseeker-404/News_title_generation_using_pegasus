Fully autonomous vehicles are moving slower than originally projected, too. However, digitization of the cabin will mean a strong market for memory in the automotive space as cars continue to become servers on wheels. Kris Baxter Micron Technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Embedded Business Unit general manager Kris Baxter said even though autonomous driving expectations have scaled back, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lots of room for growth in the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) segment. Tesla has backed away from autonomous claims and is highlighting ADAS Level 2 and Level 3, he noted. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe see an increase in that space \u00e2\u0080\u0094 adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, automatic braking, and driver monitoring systems. The overall market is going to be very strong in 2021, not for autonomous vehicles, but digitalization of the cabin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Longer term, Micron still expects autonomous vehicles to make it into the enterprise-first areas that can afford the costs associated, such as robo-taxis and long-haul trucking applications, but it the meantime, there will still be an explosion of automotive data, said Baxter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also see a shift towards centralizing vehicle computing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of computing to be done even beyond onboard infotainment systems as vehicle, autonomous or otherwise, evolve to interact more with the environment and ecosystem of service providers and vendors that provide specific functionalities that contribute that enable autonomous abilities. Aceinna, for example, makes sensing solutions for a number industries, including aerospace and automotive, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in the computing business per se, but its technology relies on it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re not doing the computing machines here or anything related to computing power,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said CEO Yang Zhao. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe focus on the sensor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But there are multiple sensors, including image and vision sensors, that require computing power for processing that data they feed to support navigation and other autonomous vehicle functions. The car of the future, like any robot smart enough to navigate itself, needs to be equipped with a whole host of sensors, algorithms and necessary processing power, he said. Yang Zhao A great deal of the computing in vehicles is geared toward working in tandem with external systems such as a GPS satellite for navigation and onboard inertial navigation, said Zhao. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a combined algorithm to make the whole system become so fast. You can reach ultimate precision in everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the chance the vehicle will get cut off from external guidance systems due to severe weather and other causes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour LIDAR can be dead and blinded, but the inertial navigation system inside the car will never get blind. It\u2019s not going to be affected by the outside environment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To keep running on their own, these systems require their own computing power and memory, and within the vehicle there also needs to be some segmentation, said Zhao. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe vehicle driving system has to be isolated completely in a closed loop by itself. Nobody else can access that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The segmentation of various automotive systems means memory needs will be somewhat varied and draw upon architectures used in other markets, such as mobile and the Internet of Things (IoT), which why all three are part of a single business unit at Western Digital, said Huibert Verhoeven, who is senior VP of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Automotive, Mobile and Emerging Markets Business Unit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe see quite a bit of overlap historically.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Within the vehicle itself there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a transition fully siloed systems with their own memory, such as flash storage for an infotainment system, to a more unified approach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heading very rapidly towards having clusters of storage for that consumer data.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Huibert Verhoeven For infotainment system with maps that are going higher in resolution, he said, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an increasing need for an architecture that ties computing and memory together, so that same flash storage expanding in capacity, as is the variety of interfaces, including eMMC and UFS. But if you want a sign that the modern vehicle is becoming a server on wheels, not only are SSDs being incorporated into infotainment systems, Verhoeven said there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even a demand for NVMe thanks to the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransportation as a services business\u00e2\u0080\u009d where the amount of data that must be logged is tremendous. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have vehicles driving around that truly are data centers on wheels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While some functions of autonomous vehicles involve real-time with communications systems, Verhoeven said there also scenarios where they are accumulating terabytes of data over the course of several days for the purposes of fleet management, for example. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of our customers actually choose to at some point to pull those drives out and to load them in racks and to offload the data that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A removable form factor and serviceability becomes important, he said. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey like the fact that they can easily operate to high capacities, and if something were to go wrong with a drive, they can easily replace those products.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Many applications are modern vehicles are leveraging core technology for other use cases in industrial, mobile and server scenarios, said Verhoeven. NVMe is appealing in some cases because of the potential data volume and latency requirements that are not unlike what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d find in a data center. But while there is some logic in reducing the number of separate data siloes with the vehicle, there still needs to some segmentation\u00e2\u0080\u0094there would be risks in putting mission critical ADAS features on the same data storage media as onboard entertainment for the kids, he said, with certain subsystems accessing data from a common pool in that cluster as it balances cost and efficiency with safety and reliability. The level of autonomy is also informing how much memory and storage ends up in a vehicle, said Verhoeven, with Level 4 and 5 expected to require exabytes by 2027. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the vast majority actually is driven by things like infotainment and ADAS that are very much a Level 2 and 3 discussion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Western Digital is seeing its business grow as OEMs embark on the more advanced Level 4 and 5 implementations, however, which is guiding how the partition of different data systems evolving. Even a vehicle that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fully autonomous requires a great deal of onboard data storage as the cabin further digitized and designers add multiple, high resolutions screens infotainment consumption (Courtesy Western Digital) But even just at Level 2 and 3 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are so many subsystems that produce information has to be displayed as part of larger sub clusters, said Verhoeven, even in lower end vehicles with some ADAS features. Even without self-driving capabilities, there could potentially be terabytes of data distributed throughout the car. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we are seeing now is that all the mainstream OEMs are putting the larger displays into a car, but also multiple displays into the vehicle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. And as advanced features trickle down to become standard in lower end vehicles, memory and storage requirements will rise, which means it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long to need at least half a terabyte. Increased autonomy and cockpit digitization is driving a transition from a fragmented architecture with individual (ECUs) around the car to having a single domain controller, said Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Baxter. Automotive engineers will increasingly turn to multi-chip packages, which combine memory and storage into one streamlined package, and GDDR6 will replace low-power DRAM for some applications. There has been a profound shift for the memory industry as the automobile has become a major driver of memory technologies, he said, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s required changes to how memory is defined and designed to get aligned with the market timing and requirements of the auto industry. At the same time, established technologies such as NOR flash still have a role in in supporting fast boot capabilities to meet driver expectations for instant-on when they turn the key in the ignition. Power is a big challenge because delivering data center on wheels requires a great dealing of computing well above 600 tera operations per second (TOP), which can demand as much as 1,000 watts of power. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just limited to the processors, but also the memory. Power consumption becomes even more critical for fully electric vehicles and creates a thermal management challenge for automotive engineers. Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach is to look at where power/performance tradeoffs are possible by employing low-power, energy-efficient memory such as LPDDR4X. More advanced processed modes, meanwhile, come with commensurate improvements in power efficiency, which are incredibly crucial for autonomous cars that run power-hungry high-performance, AI-enabled applications. Complexity is also a challenge, and underestimating it is why Level 4 and 5 autonomous vehicles have been slower out of the gate, said Robert Bielby, Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior director for automotive system architecture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u2019s still quite a bit of a disparity as far as what is really the amount of compute performance that\u2019s required to realize autonomous driving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Based on Yole Development\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rapid Adoption scenario, demand for automotive flash storage is growing, with NAND auto bid demand expected surge for autonomous Level 3 to 5 vehicles beyond 2022 (Courtesy Western Digital) Click on the image for a larger view. Like Western Digital, Micron sees a move toward clustering that would see mission critical data segmented from onboard entertainment content, while also leveraging common pools of data for efficiency, such as a central storage point where all maps are in a single location but used for different applications and this further emulates how a server is architected, said Bielby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is where you\u2019re going to start to see the concept of virtualization, so I can access the common storage pool from two different applications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly more attention being paid to security and safety, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u2019s important to the industry is that any and all memory that\u2019s being used in the automobile is auto qualified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wide spectrum of memory products, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ADAS that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving DRAM uptake or GDDR6 to support multiple screens in vehicles, said Bielby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a move towards NVMe and SSDs as a whole.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A lot of designers are taking a step back from the previous approach of adding more functionality and more capability in a piecemeal manner. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shift to taking a more holistic view to toward the architecture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRather than have multiple discreet eMMCs or UFS devices onto the system, there\u2019s a trend towards moving towards more of a consolidated, centralized storage approach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Anything that goes into a vehicle must automotive grade, he said, so while emerging memories may have some use cases, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u2019s the grease that\u2019s required to get there. My expectation is that the technologies will mature and become available for these applications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tom Coughlin Tom Coughlin, president of Coughlin Associates, said automakers are just starting to move to SSDs for infotainment data storage as prices are coming down to a point where it makes economic sense. And because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much memory needed to build a server on wheels, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inevitable that emerging memories will be considered, but they must be able to handle the extreme environments associated with automotive use cases. MRAM, for example, has been shown to handle extreme temperatures and could potentially replace NOR flash in some applications, he said. In general, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of tradeoffs to be considered when selecting memory devices for automotive environments, said Coughlin, which means finding a balance among capacity, endurance and retention. But memory also has to work with a lot of other evolving technologies going into cars, including communications and interface protocols such as Ethernet and TCP that comprise the networking aspect of a server on wheels, all of which support external data traffic to edge environment where additional processing and AI takes place. The memory and compute in vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure will need to keep up with the 5G speeds that are believed necessary to communicate with cars in real time, as well as all the training that needs to happen, said Bielby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are millions, if not billions of miles of data that you need to collect from road data that\u2019s going to help you build or train a model that\u2019s going to be capable of driving in complex automotive environments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The training side of the equation relies on high performance data centers, already hungry for memory, and connectivity in general is going to be a key component of autonomous driving, he said, to deliver real-time updates such as traffic conditions, as well as opportunities for algorithm improvement. Over the longer term, 5G will play a role in realizing cellular V2X, which means not only are cars talking to the surrounding infrastructure, but also to each other, which essentially makes vehicles on the road become a cluster of servers computing together without necessarily requiring a central cloud. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u2019s going to allow the ability to predict what\u2019s happening in the environment and understand what the behavior of a vehicle is five or 10 cars in front of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.
