Although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still the early days for LiDAR technology, automotive system engineers are working on LiDAR designs to meet resolution, range, accuracy, and latency requirements. Advances like Cepton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LiDAR sensors, based on its Micro-Motion Technology (MMT), that recognize and track objects from all four corners of the vehicle to provide a precise 3D image of the surrounding environment, and RoboSense\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RS-LiDAR-M1Pre LiDAR that incorporates a laser, a 2D MEMS scanning mirror, and a time-of-flight (ToF) sensor and claims a detectable range of 200 m, will go a long way to drive the adoption of this technology in 2020.

These devices match incumbent OLED technology in terms of response time and viewing angles and exceed OLEDs in brightness, ruggedness, and power consumption. Big markets include augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), wearables, and other mobile devices. The big drawback is still commercialization and related costs, though a lot of progress is being made as the technology matures. And one supplier making some big inroads is Plessey Semiconductors, which has demoed microLED displays for headsets, which achieve 10\u00c3\u0097 the resolution, 100\u00c3\u0097 the contrast ratio, and up to 1,000\u00c3\u0097 the luminance of traditional OLEDs with just half the power consumption. So high-volume production of microLEDs may be around the corner, even as early as 2020.

This translates into a big need for 5G devices, ranging from the infrastructure to the smartphone. Leaders like MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Samsung are already launching chipsets that promise to simplify the transition to 5G communications. Also watch for big announcements in other component areas as manufacturers gear up for the arrival of 5G.

There has been early haptics activity in the VR market, but new technologies that deliver benefits in the areas of scalability, flexibility, size, weight, and cost will make these devices a lot more attractive to XR designers as they strive to deliver a better user experience on mobile phones, tablets, and other consumer devices.

In early 2019, more than a dozen European organizations decided to partner on the development of lithium-sulfur battery technology for EVs/HEVs, indicating a big push toward commercialization.
