With rounded corners, a larger display, and built-in EKG scanner, the new Apple watch was billed in some media reports as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most sought-after gadget in the aftermath of Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fall hardware refresh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Patrick Moorhead, founder and president of Moor Insights & Strategy, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith Watch Series 4, Apple continued its differentiated approach of creating a \u00e2\u0080\u0098computer on the wrist\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that runs real apps, not just applets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He called the Series 4\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 30% bigger viewable image area as key to new uses. He added that users might prefer to \u00e2\u0080\u009crely more on their Watch than their iPhones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Apple Watch Series 4 (Photo: Apple)  Meanwhile display technology watchers are watching the Watch for an entirely different reason. They want to know when Apple will be ready to incorporate in the Watch screen microLED instead of OLED. If Apple pulls that off, the Cupertino giant, which has never been a display provider, would be nailing a technology nobody else in the world has yet mastered. To be clear, the Watch Series 4 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do microLED. There is \u00e2\u0080\u009cno surprise\u00e2\u0080\u009d there, Eric Virey, senior market and technology analyst at Yole\u00c2\u00a0D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement told us. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that Apple is still very active and committed to its microLED display development, but even if they were close to deliver the \u00e2\u0080\u0098perfect display\u00e2\u0080\u0099 they need for their products, it will still take time to set up the supply chain, ramp manufacturing and qualify the displays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Virey predicted last year that microLED could arrive in the wearable device market, such as Apple Watch, in late 2019. When we caught up with him last week, he acknowledged pushing back his prediction for the arrival of high-volume consumer microLED products by at least two years\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 to 2021. What changed? Where is Apple today with its microLED technology? Who else in the industry has joined the microLED rush? And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big delay in the microLED rollout?\u00c2\u00a0 We sat down with Virey and asked about what now appears to be an elusive breakthrough to microLED. Why microLED?  MicroLED displays consist of an array of microscopic LEDs forming individual pixel elements. Unlike OLED, microLED uses conventional gallium-nitride LED technology. MicroLED offers many promises, ranging from high brightness, high dynamic range and a wide color gamut to fast refresh rates, wide viewing angles and low power drain. MicroLED proponents claim total brightness can outshine OLED products by a factor of 30 while offering higher efficiency in lux per watt. So, how would microLED change the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Watch experience? The biggest factor is the microLED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lower power consumption, which Virey said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould translate into extended battery life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Equally important is the microLED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brightness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat means excellent readability at any angle and in any condition, even direct bright sunlight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Virey stressed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a valuable feature for many use cases when people don't want to have to fiddle with the position of the watch or cover it with their hand, so they can read the display.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
