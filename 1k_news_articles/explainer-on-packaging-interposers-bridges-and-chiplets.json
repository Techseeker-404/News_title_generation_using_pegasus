Here\u2019s what we learned. The IC industry is clearing its path forward by relying on what was once one of its most mundane tools: packaging. There are several relatively new approaches to IC packaging, and they can all help significantly boost IC-level performance. The great thing is that many of these technologies are mature enough and have been around long enough that they are now accessible to even startups and universities. While some of these technologies are already being offered by major foundries, one of the newest and most promising \u00e2\u0080\u0094 chiplets technology \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is still immature. What\u2019s missing that would help advance the state of the art, says Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ramune Nagisetty, would be the creation of more standardized interfaces for mixing and matching the silicon components in advanced packages. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe exciting part is lowering the barriers to play in this ecosystem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTen years from now, we\u2019ll see fruits of this approach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Recommended:  Chiplet Ecosystem Slowly Picks up Steam  Nagisetty is Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s packaging maven; her formal title is director of process and product integration at Intel Technology Development. Intel, one of the last bastions of advanced semiconductor process technology in the U.S., has designated advanced packaging technology as one of the keys to its future. In a recent conversation with EE Times, Nagisetty said Intel has a technology roadmap for every one of its packaging vectors, just as it has always had roadmaps for process technology. Ramune Nagisetty Packaging was long the least glamorous aspect of the semiconductor business, but about 15 years ago it started becoming apparent that packaging could become a performance bottleneck, but with a bit of innovation, not only could that bottleneck be avoided, but new packaging approaches could actually enhance IC performance. Intel has been doing this for a while now. The company proposed its Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) technology in 2008 as a way to provide high density interconnect of heterogeneous chips, Nagisetty observed. EMIB is a variant of 2.5D technology. The common approach to 2.5D packaging is to use a silicon interposer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a layer of silicon with vias that is sandwiched (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinterposed\u00e2\u0080\u009d) between two chips. Intel believes interposers are often physically too large, so its EMIB uses a bridge die with multiple routing layers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew technologies need a tipping point before they start getting used,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nagisetty said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe inflection point was the rise of disruptive AI architectures based on neural networks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just the trend, but a specific event, the ImageNet competition in 2012. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was an important point \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it showed the feasibility of neural networks, and it gave rise to accelerators and high bandwidth memory inside the package \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that began the toehold of memory in the package,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Historically, the general trajectory of the semiconductor industry has been to integrate more and more functions on-chip, but for some advanced IC designs, that was not recommended or not possible. First, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not always possible for a company to put all the circuitry necessary from some applications on one giant die because from a production standpoint, the maximum size of a die is reticle-limited. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe second point that drives this is the rising design cost for re-use and the need for IP portability for a particular technology node,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nagisetty noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLogic technologies are becoming more specialized, whether for mobile or high performance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The example she gave was a SerDes; there little if any need to implement a SerDes at the same technology node as the logic in advanced IC designs. More to the point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to tailor a technology (e.g., a SerDes) to a technology node. The SerDes example specifically references Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Stratix FPGAs. Nagisetty said there is a menu of Stratix FPGAs, implemented at six different technology nodes available from three different foundries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Stratix was first with 58 gigabit per second SerDes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt allowed us to be more competitive and first to market with the high-speed SerDes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In short, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a benefit to disaggregation. The third reason to embrace advanced packaging is to gain agility and flexibility, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe value of mixing and matching chiplets from different technologies is becoming clear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two really good examples, Nagisetty said, are Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kaby Lake G and Lakefield products. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith Kaby Lake G we integrated third-party IP inside our package, which allowed us to create a smaller form factor for high performance mobile gaming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The third-party IP was a Radeon accelerator from AMD. That was a clear example of using advanced packaging to improve end-use performance, she said. Where Kaby Lake G used Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EMIB 2.5D approach, Lakefield relies on die stacking \u00e2\u0080\u0093 3D stacking. Intel calls its version of 3D stacking Foveros. Intel\u2019s Foveros technology Lakefield, she said, is \u00e2\u0080\u009can example of how packaging can give you the smallest X-Y footprint. The end user can see the benefit either in the performance or form factor, or both.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There is a rich set of packaging technologies, and to make things even more interesting, they can be mixed-and-matched. Intel, for example, recently introduced \u00e2\u0080\u009cco-EMIB,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is a combination of EMIB and Foveros. Last year Intel introduced two more advanced packaging variations, omni-directional Interconect (ODI), which from an architectural standpoint is a stacking approach that allows for cantilevering chips. There are several benefits including power delivery to the top die in the stack through through-silicon vias (TSVs). Intel, TSMC and others are working on an approach called copper-to-copper hybrid bonding, yet another variation of stacking that might lead to innovations in 3D ICs and the connecting of so many DRAM chips the combination is being referred to as DRAM cubes. We asked Nagisetty if there are clear paths for continuously refining these packaging technologies, similar to the way successive production process nodes have always been plotted out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a packaging technology roadmap for every single one of our packaging vectors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she responded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, we have one for interposer, one for decreasing pitch from 55 microns, going to 36 microns. And 36 is not where we end. Foveros will go to 25. Hybrid bonding will start at 10 and move down in pitch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The disaggregation, and associated examples such as Kaby Lake G, have sparked dreams among chip designers of mixing and matching functions from different suppliers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just one. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the key concept of chiplets. From a commercial standpoint, the chiplets approach makes a lot of sense. The cost of a highly integrated system on a chip (SoC) can be very high \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so high it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prohibitive for many. Furthermore, the complexity of such highly integrated semiconductor systems makes manufacturing more challenging; there is a direct relationship between higher complexity and yield loss. The U.S. Department of Defense is interested for those reasons and others. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is supporting a program to encourage the market for chiplets. This is DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take on the technology: The monolithic nature of state-of-the-art SoCs is not always acceptable for Department of Defense (DoD) or other low-volume applications due to factors such as high initial prototype costs and requirements for alternative material sets. To enhance overall system flexibility and reduce design time for next-generation products, the Common Heterogeneous Integration and Intellectual Property (IP) Reuse Strategies (CHIPS) program seeks to establish a new paradigm in IP reuse. Turning to chiplets can significantly reduce cost, compared to a more complex SoC.

[There are two distinct programs using the acronym CHIPS. They are separate, but exacerbating possible confusion, they are congruent. Congress has proposed a bill called the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act. The CHIPS for America Act does allocate funding specifically for advanced packaging research, but it does not specifically mention DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CHIPS program.] Intel is, of course, participating in DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CHIPS program. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Stratix FPGA is sort of the hub of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nagisetty noted. The key to success \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of the CHIPS program specifically and of chiplets technology in general \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is going to be the creation of more standardized interfaces so that chiplets from other companies can be connected. To that end, Intel has contributed an interconnect technology called the advanced interface bus (AIB), which the company created in 2018. Starting in 2019, Intel has been making AIB available with a royalty-free license. (It can be found on GitHub.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the seed and toehold of what I believe will develop into an ecosystem, and innovation will be unlocked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nagisetty said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be similar to the way boards developed \u00e2\u0080\u0093where have things like PCI Express \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that allows companies to build products based on an interface standard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early days, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of complexity to deal with, and also business models that need to be worked out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what I love about it is that people can participate in this ecosystem. Before, the barrier was really high. But now, there are some startups and universities participating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, a body helping to shepherd the creation of standards around chiplets technology would be not just useful, but \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nagisetty said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I could fast-forward in time, this would be taken care of. AIB has been the best so far, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to be done. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I would wish for more effort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One organization that is taking its first tentative steps toward filling that void is the Open Compute Project (OCP), which has a fledgling program proposing the development of an open domain specific accelerator (ODSA). The Open Compute Project (OCP) says the conclusion from this projection from IHS Markit is that there is an \u00e2\u0080\u009cImmediate opportunity for chiplets and an open interface.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Click directly on the graph for a larger view.]It might not be immediately obvious how a group concerned directly with data center server technology gets so intimately involved with chiplets. The OCP starts with the observation that there will be an ongoing proliferation of new workloads that data centers will have to handle. Currently, the best solution for optimizing silicon systems for any given new workload is to create an SoC. But \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as noted above \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that gets expensive. One way of reducing the cost of silicon systems for emerging workloads would be to use chiplets technology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how the OCP gets involved with chiplets. Today, different companies exploring chiplets technology tend to rely at least in part on \u00c2\u00a0internally-developed design tools, and all chiplets interfaces are proprietary, according to the OCP. \u00e2\u0080\u009cODSA seeks to democratize this evolution of chiplet and SIP [system in package] technology for the larger mass market through an open eco-system marketplace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to an OCP document called Intro to ODSA, which can be accessed from this page.
