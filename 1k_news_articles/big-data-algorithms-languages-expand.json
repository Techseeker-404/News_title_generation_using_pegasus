What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new is the large amounts of data we have to run against them and the intensity of engineering around them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Inderpal Bhandari, a veteran computer scientist who was named IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first chief data officer. He described work using generative adversarial networks to pit two neural nets against each other to create a better one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an engineering idea that leads to more algorithms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there is a lot of that kind of engineering around neural networks now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In some ways, the algorithms are anticipating tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardware. For example, quantum algorithms are becoming hot because they \u00e2\u0080\u009callow you to do some of what quantum computers would do if they were available, and these algorithms are coming of age,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Anthony Scriffignano, chief data scientist for Dun & Bradstreet. Deep belief networks are another hot emerging approach. Scriffignano describes it as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca non-regressive way to modify your goals and objectives while you are still learning \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as such, it has characteristics of tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neuromorphic computers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d systems geared to mimic the human brain. At Stanford, the DeepDive algorithms developed by Chris R\u00c3\u00a9 have been getting traction. They help computers understand and use unstructured data like text, tables, and charts as easily as relational databases or spreadsheets, said Stephen Eglash, who heads the university\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data science initiative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch of existing data is un- or semi-structured. For example, we can read a datasheet with ease, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for a computer to make sense of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  So far, Deep Dive has helped oncologists use computers to interpret photos of tumors. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being used by the New York attorney general as a law enforcement tool. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also in use across a large number of companies working in different domains. DeepDive is unique in part because \u00e2\u0080\u009cit IDs and labels everything and then uses learning engines and probabilistic techniques to figure out what they mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Eglash. While successful, the approach is just one of many algorithm efforts in academia these days. Others focus on areas such as computer vision or try to ID anomalies in real-time data streams. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe could go on and on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Eglash. \u00c2\u00a0 Next page: Hands on with interesting data sets     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
