One of the first industries embracing this new breed of printers is defense. With the shift to Industry 4.0, 3D printing is now evolving into true additive manufacturing as illustrated by the many reports of high-volume applications in the automotive, hearing-aid, glasses, and aerospace sectors. The steady momentum underpinning additive manufacturing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adoption is propelled by its inherent advantages over today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s traditional manufacturing processes. RF circuits for wireless systems designed by Harris Corp.   Defense industry benefits  The highly security-sensitive defense sector is ripe for additive manufacturing solutions that offer them speed (for printing parts for battlefield repairs on the fly, for example), rapid product customization capabilities, print durable and reliable components in-house, and protect their sensitive and proprietary designs. With increasing pressure to accelerate time-to-market, defense manufacturers are turning to additive manufacturing to meet deadlines in delivering the latest systems. For example, to supplement its legacy manufacturing process, Raytheon has announced goals to use additive manufacturing to 3D print almost every component of a guided weapon, including rocket engines and fins, as well as parts for guidance and control systems. Similarly, Lockheed Martin is using additive manufacturing across prototyping, tooling and production of components to rapidly implement innovation. Lockheed Martin recently announced its two-year, $5.8 million contract with the Department of Defense\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive branch, Office of Naval Research, to advance automation of industrial additive manufacturing systems. Next step for additive printing  One area where 3D printing may have the greatest impact on the defense industry, however, is in the ability to go beyond mechanical parts and additively manufacture functional electronic components in the form of 3D-printed circuit boards and antennas. Whether this is to make the final production part, perform in-field replacements and repairs, or as part of a drive towards distributed digital manufacturing at the location of need, such ubiquitous availability of on-demand additive manufacturing will lead to entirely new value chains across industry verticals.\u00c2\u00a0 Traditional manufacturing of electronics introduces a security threat for industries like defense. Sending out proprietary designs or other IP to third-party firms for prototyping puts sensitive \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and sometimes classified \u00e2\u0080\u0093 information at risk. Additive manufacturing can ease such concerns related to sensitive information. Using additive manufacturing, defense related organizations can develop and test proprietary designs for electronics, such as antennas, circuit boards and more in-house without ever needing to resort to third-party prototyping, test or fabrication facilities. This lessens the risk of IP theft significantly and keeps costs down while significantly speeding the research and development process. Emerging defense applications   Additive manufacturing is also opening the door for a wide range of new defense applications. With additive manufacturing technology, defense developers, engineers, and product designers will eventually be able to 3D-print complete devices, with electronics printed within them.\u00c2\u00a0 The design frontiers are virtually limitless and include geometries and other properties beyond the capabilities of traditional manufacturing processes. Devices like these might be created to replace damaged devices for military personnel on deployment, for instance. "}
