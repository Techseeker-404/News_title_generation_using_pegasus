The physical damage is often compounded by mental stress, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disease (PTSD). The value of any scientific development that can give back physical capability and independence to those who have lost it is beyond words. This brings us to AI-powered prosthetic hands, which \u00e2\u0080\u009clearn\u00e2\u0080\u009d from repetitive actions and enable hand amputees to make an unlimited number of grips and gestures. Artificial intelligence (AI) takes these prosthetic hands to new levels when compared with the traditional prosthetics that rely on electromyography (EMG) alone. EMG measures of\u00c2\u00a0 muscular electrical activity in response to a nerve\u2019s stimulation in order to move the hand. The new prosthetics also rely on EMG, but the addition of AI leads to significant improvements in how they perform. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe biggest difference between the AI prosthetic hand and the standard prosthetic hand is the AI algorithms that facilitate users in their daily usage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Qing Zhu,\u00c2\u00a0 product manager and regulatory analyst at BrainRobotics, which innovated the AI prosthetic hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUsers are able to have a shorter training time while the captured EMG signals are analyzed into a more precise control of the prosthetic hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Training time is required as the user learns to use the hand and understands the interactions and relationships between what he wills the prosthetic to do, the electronic impulses from muscles that result, and the ability of these impulses to operate a prosthetic hand.

Initially, there is a hand \u00e2\u0080\u009csignal training\u00e2\u0080\u009d database in the\u00c2\u00a0 cloud servers. It creates a hand control model that fits the usage patterns of the user and his muscle control patterns. The prosthetic hand is then embedded with this control model once the initial signal training is complete. Zhu also noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif an update is needed, the signal training session can be redone, and the new model can be replaced in the hand remotely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Over time, machine learning (ML) in the hand \u00e2\u0080\u009clearns\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the repetitive use patterns of the user and refines the intelligence that is built into the hand, so hand control\u00c2\u00a0 more closely conforms to the user\u2019s usage habits and needs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe use AI algorithms and machine learning to capture the nuances and the movement similarities to allow for the best control of the hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Zhu. On the physical side of the prosthetic hand design, a HIFI socket (high-fidelity interface with osseostabilizing technology), developed by Biodesigns, Inc., is used to facilitate tighter alignments between the prosthetic hand and bone joints. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a complete departure from standard-of-care sockets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Zhu. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe HiFi Interface focuses on manipulating soft tissue via an alternating, circumferential array of targeted compression to capture the wearer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying bone. This enables better control and synchronization between the prosthetic hand and the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural skeletal motion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Army Capt.

He was able to directly update the firmware on his mobile prosthetic hand app, which is not possible with other prosthetic hands on the market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor our development team, this was an excellent reminder that each user will have their own unique needs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zhu said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will be adding more features to the app so individual users can customize the hand based on their own needs and habits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
