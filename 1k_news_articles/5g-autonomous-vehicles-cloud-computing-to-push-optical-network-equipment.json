After all, it takes lots of equipment to deliver network services. A new report from Information Gatekeepers highlights three major contributors to the growth of networking equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 namely, dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs), and routers and switches.    Report author Clifford Holliday investigated three of the drivers for network equipment from 2018 to 2025: 5G, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing. EE Times spoke with Holliday to learn about these drivers.    When he started his research, Holliday was surprised that 5G and autonomous vehicles weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t further along, given the hype surrounding both. 5G and autonomous cars are still in development and years away from impacting the market for optical network equipment. If you follow these technologies, you already know that. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil I started my research,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Holliday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believed the hype.\u00e2\u0080\u009d      Over time, 5G and autonomous vehicles could impact the markets for network equipment, but not today.     \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait a minute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you might say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hearing about 5G deployments and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen driverless cars. What do you mean they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen driverless cars, but not fully autonomous cars to the point at which they communicate with a network or to each other. Regarding 5G, with trials beginning, can you buy a 5G phone today? According to Holliday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the impact of 5G until 2020 or 2021. Of the three market drivers, only cloud computing is here today, and that could change as 5G rolls out.    Another reason that Holliday calls the impact of autonomous vehicles \u00e2\u0080\u009ciffy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is politics, law, and accidents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem such as an accident, it sets things back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. You can well imagine the lawsuits, which will push a need for regulation.    Although cloud computing is well-established, 5G could change that as well. Why? The need for low latency and high reliability could push factory automation, and autonomous vehicles could push computational power from the network core to the edge, as was noted at the 2018 Brooklyn 5G summit.    At the summit, the concept of moving computing power to the network edge brought on the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill carriers become computing providers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Holliday suggested that carriers may enter the computing business in terms of operating the hardware and providing cooling and power. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause of a reduction in equipment size, the telcos may have excess space and power to add computing to their services. The carriers are good at providing infrastructure, but as far as owning or leasing computing power, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely because they currently don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the expertise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Perhaps the carriers will contract that business to those with the computing expertise.    Anyone who works on or follows 5G knows that it will come, but 5G has many aspects. When you hear about a telecom carrier claiming that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s building a nationwide 5G network, what does that mean? 5G will consist of several technologies; the marketers will claim 5G networks when the carriers deploy something that is beyond LTE. Keep in mind that LTE is still being deployed and improved. Early 5G will have a strong LTE component but will be marketed simply as 5G. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLTE and 4G will continue to grow before 5G takes over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Holliday.    You may be surprised by the report\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of IoT. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason for that. Holliday concluded in our interview that 5G deployment will drive IoT and IIoT beyond what LTE can do, which will accelerate the need for network equipment. Given how 5G is needed to both force computing to the edge and bring on autonomous vehicles, it looks to be the true force behind more optical networking equipment in the wired backhaul, something that Daniel Gonzalez covered in \u00e2\u0080\u009c5G front haul, backhaul architectures present wireline test challenges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
