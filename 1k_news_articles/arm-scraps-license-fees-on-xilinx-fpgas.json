The two companies said that they are collaborating to offer completely zero-cost access to Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soft processor IP, integrated with Xilinx tools and software development solutions to accelerate design starts on FPGA. Offered through the Arm DesignStart program, it will enable developers to simplify development of Arm cores spanning Xilinx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Spartan, Artix and Zynq portfolios.  Recommended  Xilinx Details SoC-like FPGAs   Arm says it made the cores free in FPGAs due to greater pressure from OEMs to develop flexible, application-optimized designs at a faster pace and with less investment. Asked whether the move is to take on the growth of open-source RISC cores as a route to rapid development of low-volume processor-based SoCs, Phil Burr, director, portfolio product management, Arm, told EE Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about making sure that people using Arm have maximum choices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To meet these demands, Burr said it is crucial for developers to have easy access to the most widely adopted processors and the broadest set of software, tools, and know-how, whether on FPGAs, SoCs, or single-board computers (SBCs). The collaboration enables deployment of heterogeneous compute using a single-processor architecture. For example, a Cortex-M soft IP processor can be used alongside an Arm-based SoC using Cortex-A processors built into the Zynq SoC. This, the company says, will help designers to allocate processing tasks to the right compute engine, whether high-performance Cortex-A, real-time Cortex-M, or custom logic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Cortex-M1 and -M3 can now be implemented directly in the FPGA fabric rather than sitting alongside the FPGA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Burr. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOEMs have told us that they want the CPU access across all products so that they can reuse the software. This is important when you consider that software is the biggest part of the development cost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Arm soft CPU can now be programmed as part of the FPGA fabric. (Source: Arm)   "}
