If Coretec\u2019s exploration of nanotech is successful, that would make EVs instantly more practical. Automotive manufactures are striving to create a more sustainable future with EVs, but the market for EVs still lacks sufficient infrastructure for refueling, and benefits from improved battery technology. A robust fast-charging network and silicon anode batteries could be keys to making the EV market more rapidly viable. In an interview with Michael Kraft, CEO of the Coretec group, he highlighted the properties of these new solutions and analyzed which materials could contribute to the development of e-mobility. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur focus is on advanced materials that enable next-generation technologies in the global challenge area. Semiconductors, solar panels, LEDs, and silicon anode next-generation batteries for high power and fast charging. We\u2019re always looking for additional materials that enable these next-generation technologies, materials companies to partner with or acquire.\u00c2\u00a0 Currently, we are putting a majority of our resources into the commercialization of cyclohexasilane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kraft. The company, based in New York City but with roots in the Midwest, believes this and a few other new materials will be applicable to several markets, including energy storage, solar, solid state lighting, printable electronics and 3D displays. Kraft pointed out that the company\u2019s product portfolio is based on the production of silicon products, starting with cyclohexasilane (Si6H12, or simply CHS), a liquid that converts to pure silicon when exposed to heat or UV radiation; it is amorphous silicon but becomes crystalline silicon as exposure increases. CHS is the key element for advanced energy storage applications. Through a partnership with Evonik (a specialty chemicals company in Germany), the Coretec Group is providing customers with CHS samples for evaluation. For production scale, Evonik can easily supply large-scale quantities. CHS can be varied in purity to meet specific application needs with pricing correlated to level of purity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCoretec Cyclohexasilane is ideal for applications where purity, safety, fast deposition rate and low-temperature deposition of silicon and/or doped silicon (C, Ge, B, Co and P) are important,\u00e2\u0080\u009d commented Kraft.

Electric vehicles (EVs) Electric vehicles are an environmentally friendly alternative to their common petrol-powered counterparts, but they lack one crucial quality: convenience. The EV infrastructure and battery capacities are not comparable with current vehicles. While there seems to be a petrol station every meter, electric vehicle charging stations are not yet common, which means that drivers have to make detailed charging plans well in advance of their journey. An efficient infrastructure with fast charging and a long-range battery should contribute to the success of EVs. Many manufacturers are looking for new solutions (materials) to overcome the limitations of graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries. New silicon anode battery technology promises to charge batteries quickly to over 80% of their capacity in 5-10 minutes, without physically damaging the battery, while also increasing the energy density by 2-3\u00c3\u0097. Upcoming Gen 2.0 lithium-ion batteries will see new materials incorporated to increase energy density and solve swelling problems. Kraft highlighted how many companies are working with materials engineers to add nanotechnology into the manufacturing process, including incorporating silicon precursors such as cyclohexasilane. Kraft explained how CHS offers a much faster rate of device fabrication than traditional precursors and, more importantly, generates amorphous nanostructures, which means batteries can be charged quickly without swelling. Such material also helps to withstand many charges and discharge cycles, an important consideration for e-mobility. \u201cCoretec Cyclohexasilane makes it possible to increase energy density by replacing the graphite anode commonly used in lithium-ion batteries with silicon-carbon nanostructures and alloys. These materials store more lithium ions, increasing energy density while reducing eventual destruction,\u201d said Kraft. Cyclohexasilane is a liquid silicon precursor for lithium-ion battery anode applications. Its liquid state offers advantages for processing low-cost carbon-silicon nanostructures as a direct replacement for graphite in high-energy lithium ions. A key advantage is the high charge/discharge life cycle and higher energy density. Kraft pointed out that Tesla stated it is moving towards the silicon anode solution, representing a significant milestone for EV batteries. Consumers demand a battery that can charge faster, travel farther and last longer, and today\u2019s materials do not adequately address this challenge. New features for SiC manufacturing Power electronics is evolving at an impressive pace through wide bandgap material needs. Power electronics for EVs can effectively be enhanced with Silicon Carbide solutions that meet design parameters and make an essential contribution to system performance and long-term reliability. Silicon carbide (SiC) devices are increasingly used in high-voltage power converters with strict requirements regarding size, weight, and efficiency because they offer a number of attractive characteristics when compared with commonly used silicon (Si) devices. The on-state resistance and switching losses are considerably lower, and SiC provides about 3\u00c3\u0097 more thermal conductivity than silicon, allowing faster heat dissipation from components. This is important because when Si-based devices become smaller in terms of area, it becomes more difficult to extract the heat generated by electrical conversion processes, and SiC dissipates the heat better. SiC wafers are very complex compared to traditional silicon wafers and as the market demands them, a number of barriers need to be resolved when it comes to mass commercialization and total replacement of more traditional forms of silicon. Silicon precursors known as cyclohexasilane (CHS) can help. High-performance SiC devices have been limited by the inability to grow SiC films on semiconductor wafers with low defect density, as well as the additional difficulties of adhering the SiC layer to the substrate: \u00ce\u00b1-SiC (e.g., 4H-SiC, 6H-SiC) and \u00ce\u00b2-SiC (3C-SiC) are well-known examples. The wide adoption of \u00ce\u00b2-SiC as an alternative material for power electronics presents several challenges. One, in particular, is the need for a silicon precursor that is not only economical but chemically viable to develop advanced films and strutures of SiC devices. CHS can create \u00ce\u00b2-SiC thin films on a variety of substrates under normal conditions. In addition, CHS allows easy p-doping of materials into \u00ce\u00b2-SiC films.\u00c2\u00a0 This precursor can help the development of power electronics by simplifying the process from transport to storage and silicon deposition.\u00c2\u00a0 Kraft pointed out that CHS offers the potential to overcome the historical limitations of SiC semiconductor production in a cost-effective way. The autonomy of an electric car directly reflects the efficiency of its powertrain and energy management system. In addition to the necessary infrastructures, such as powerful fast-charging systems available everywhere, the EV must have improved SiC power electronics and a silicon-based anode battery with higher energy density and improved charging times.\u00c2\u00a0 Electric Vehicles with these improvements will not only be adopted at a large scale and replace today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s petrol vehicle, but they will create the sustainable e-mobility future the world needs.
