You\u2019re opening a Star Wars-type headquarters, you have the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most admired and profitable consumer product, your coffers are brimming with cash, and your customers are eagerly waiting for your next product. Further, you are taking in a reported 95% of the total available profit made on these products. Most would say that the job is to \u201ccarry on\u201d doing more of the same. Sure, you have a stable of lawyers on the payroll and they\u2019re anxious for a chance to play their part. After all, this attack group is a big advantage at no extra expense because you\u2019re paying them anyway. Why not deploy them? They will protect you and show the world that you are a force to be reckoned with. Specifically, I am delving into the thinking behind Apple\u2019s legal strategy as implemented against Qualcomm.  What does Apple have to gain? Apple\u2019s profit for each iPhone sold leads all smartphone competitors. According to a report by IHS Markit, Apple sold the 32 Gbyte iPhone 7 for about three times the cost of materials. Such profit margins enhance the company\u2019s status as the world\u2019s biggest company in almost all respects: revenues, profit, cash reserves, and so on. But, there can never be enough.  Apples sells a 32 Gbyte iPhone 7 for about 1/3 of its materials cost. "}
