EE Times\u2019 Silicon Valley Bureau Chief Rick Merritt and I were there and posted several reports. Here\u2019s a summary of what went down. The annual \u201cCase of the Closed Eye\u201d panel was held on Tuesday, January 31st. This year marked the panel\u2019s 15th edition, which focused on 400G signal integrity. The takeaway from this panel is that, while PAM4 signals have taken hold for 56-Gbps transmissions (x8 for 400G), the standards are still in development in IEEE and OIF committees. One such issue is over which test pattern to use. The photo below shows a comparison in eye diagrams using PRBS13Q (8,191 symbols) and PRBS17Q (131,071 symbols).  The technical sessions and exhibits opened the following day. At one session, attendees were treated to how Nokia Bell Labs and Teledyne LeCroy created the world\u2019s fastest PAM4 signal, running at 390 Gbps.  In System-in-Package Gets 100G Link, Rick Merritt reports on how the CEI-112G project \u00e2\u0080\u0094 launched January 19, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could \u201cpave the way for a new class of high-end chips that don\u2019t depend on Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law for performance gains.\u201d The intent is to reduce the cost of implementing 2.5D chip stacks. Merritt continued on page 2, reporting on how engineers from Xilinx simulated three copper links that carry 100-Gbps signals over copper wires that jump over more lossy PCB traces.    As with all trade shows, there were new product introductions. Tektronix introduced a BERTScope that can communicate with a device-under-test. Get the details, including a video demonstration.  National Instruments debuted its VirtualBench that now has a 500-MHz, four-channel oscilloscope.  Rohde & Schwarz introduced a 6-GHz version of its RTO line of oscilloscopes.  With PAM4 being so popular at DesignCon, there were many demonstrations of new products. You can find videos on equipment from Teledyne LeCroy and Multilane in DesignCon 2017 video: Expected and unexpected products. What were the \u201cunexpected\u201d products? Well, you\u2019ll just have to see for yourself. While your at it, be sure to see Fun Things at DesignCon 2017. DesignCon 2018 will take place from January 30th to Feb. 1st. \u00e2\u0080\u0094Martin Rowe, Senior Technical Editor   "}
