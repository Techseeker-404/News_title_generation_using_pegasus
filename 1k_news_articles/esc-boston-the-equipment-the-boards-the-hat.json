This year's unusually cold March and half of April left me wondering if the snow would return when ESC was here last week.    ESC Boston occupied a small corner of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, most of which was consumed by exhibits on manufacturing and medical equipment. Even so, the corner of the hall dedicated to electronics had more than its share of test equipment. It even had a few embedded systems on display.

The 3000 series extends the WaveSurfer range's analog bandwidth on both the low end (now 100 MHz) and the high end (now 1 GHz). All models feature a 10.1-in. capacitive touchscreen display, 20 Msamples of memory, and a power analysis software package. Photo by Martin Rowe.        The Rohde & Schwarz RTB2004 10-bit, four-channel oscilloscope has bandwidth options of 70 MHz, 100 MHz, 200 MHz, and 300 MHz. Photo by Martin Rowe.         Rigol's DS2202E oscilloscope has two channels and 200-MHz bandwidth. Photo by Martin Rowe.         Siglent's SDX2304X oscilloscope features 2-Gsamples/s sample rate, 140-Msamples memory depth, and 140,000-waveforms/s capture rate. Photo by Martin Rowe.         Tektronix MSO5 series oscilloscopes let you choose one analog or eight digital channels for each input. Photo by Martin Rowe.   "}
