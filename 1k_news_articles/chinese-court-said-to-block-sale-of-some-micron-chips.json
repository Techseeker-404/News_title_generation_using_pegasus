Micron (Boise, Idaho) said it has not yet received any injunction and would not comment further until reviewing the documents. UMC (Hsinchu, Taiwan) said the injunction, issued by Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court, enjoins Micron from selling in China 26 DRAM and NAND-related items, including certain SSDs and memory sticks.
