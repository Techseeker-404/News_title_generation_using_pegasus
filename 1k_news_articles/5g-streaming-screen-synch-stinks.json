Rarely does the game itself live up to the build-up, though. This past Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s game was, well, one of the lousiest Super Bowls I can recall. Not only was it a lopsided game: My team lost, and so did my boxes. But even when the game itself comes up short, there are redeeming things about the Super Bowl, which has achieved near holiday status in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, apparently, even in the rest of the world where football means something else entirely. Super Bowl Sunday is likely the only time that people pay as much attention to the commercials as they do to the game. Some 96.4 million people watched the game on Feb 7, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just in the U.S. And though that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lowest number since 2007, Toyota, T-Mobile, State Farm and GM were among the eager advertisers that ponied up some $5.6 million for a 30-second spot to reach those 192 million eyeballs. Thanks to the internet, Super Bowl commercials live on far beyond their Super Bowl moment. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sneaked a re-peek into the DoorDash Sesame Street commercial a few times since Sunday to get another listen to Daveed Diggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gorgeous voice. Tech companies get it. Apple famously launched the Mac during a Super Bowl commercial in 1984, back when it was called the Macintosh. In 2014, Sonos used color to represent music flowing into different rooms in a commercial for its wireless multiroom music products. Mophie ran an ad depicting global disasters tied to a dying cell phone battery as a pitch for its battery packs six years ago. This year, Alexa morphed into hunky Michael B. Jordan in an Amazon ad. The Super Bowl has also been the launching pad for broadcast technology. The first major sports event broadcast in HD was the 2000 Super Bowl on ABC. I had a Super Bowl party that year, and secured \u00e2\u0080\u0094 very carefully and temporarily \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a $25,000 42-inch Runco plasma TV for the event to write up for a tech column. My rear-projection analog TV was in the living room. The plasma HD was in the basement. My guests were seeing HD for the first time and most were stunned by the crisp images and vibrant colors. But the experience was far from perfect. ABC only had a couple of HD cameras so the views were limited, and a JV broadcast crew announced the game for the alternate HD feed. I can still hear a friend demand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is Phil Simms?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yeah, yeah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the picture was nice, but she wanted the play-by-play she was used to. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing about cutting-edge tech. You have to endure growing pains. This year, Verizon had the tech spotlight, using the wider bandwidth of 5G cellular networks to deliver special features to the 25,000 fans attending the game in person at Raymond James Stadium along with iPhone 12 and select Samsung 5G phone owners viewing at home. In a press release the Monday before the game, the wireless carrier bragged about a Fortnite activation for fans attending the game, the $80 million it pumped into the Tampa area for 5G deployments and the ability for fans to watch the game in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cco-viewing experience\u00e2\u0080\u009d with friends via the Yahoo Sports app. The perk that intrigued me most was the chance to select different camera angles from my phone. I dutifully downloaded the Verizon 5G SuperStadium in the NFL mobile app the morning of the game. I opted into alerts so I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss anything that CBS, Verizon or the NFL wanted me to know. At 6:30 p.m., I got a text on my watch alerting me to kickoff, so I grabbed a Heineken, Doritos and guac and settled in. I pulled up the app and saw that if I wanted, I could watch the game free via the app. That was a nice nod to cord-cutters, I thought, but who, really, would want to watch a football game on a window inside a 6.7-inch screen? When I clicked the camera angle tab to see which of the five options I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pick first, it was ruh-roh. The camera feeds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the main feed of the live game on the app \u00e2\u0080\u0094 weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in sync with my TV. At first the app was way behind. CBS had cut to a commercial by the time the app finished with the coin toss. Then the app locked up. When I closed out and opened the app again, it was ahead of the TV by about 10 seconds. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fun at all to try to watch a different \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and miniature \u00e2\u0080\u0094 camera angle knowing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see the play again in a few seconds on the big screen. \u00c2\u00a0  So the camera angles were dead to me from the start. I wondered how it was working with people trying to watch the game together via the Yahoo app. In the past I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried watching a baseball game with a friend only to have the friend cheer or curse a few seconds before I knew what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on. That wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fun, either. In the second half, after I started losing interest in the game, I played with the camera angles a little more. I discovered wide receivers and their defensive shadows don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a lot when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not involved in a particular play. Sometimes the cameras went in way too close; on fast-motion scenes, that made me a little seasick. The one thing I really wanted to do \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have instant replay on demand \u00e2\u0080\u0094 wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t available. I wanted to watch the goal-line stand of the Chiefs in Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of their few highlights of the day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but the app wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that. Other weird tech things happened during the game. The app wanted access to my phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camera, which I refused. Why does the NFL want access to my camera, I wondered? When I observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNice tackle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d at one point, Alexa piped up, saying something that sounded like \u00e2\u0080\u009cPringle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said her name sternly since I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t summoned her, and she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice of you to say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another Super Bowl, another tech project in the books. Even the best tech couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have saved this game. No instant replay necessary.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
