Tan, vice president and general manager of Automotive Ethernet Solutions at NXP. He predicts that in 2025 in-vehicle networking will cost more than computing, considering the huge volume of data generated by an AV loaded with sensors and how quickly that data must be distributed. The automotive industry already uses a variety of in-vehicle connectivity technologies. They range from CAN, FlexRay and LIN to MOST and LVDS.\u00c2\u00a0 Many are custom-built interfaces, some tailored for specific automotive applications. They have proven robust and reliable. But once a new generation of auto tech, with AVs and ADAS, starts sending and routing megabits or gigabits of onboard data, no current automotive connectivity interface suffices. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where Ethernet comes in. System architects at car OEMs have already identified Ethernet as the key in-vehicle backbone network, NXP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tan explained. They do not look at the Ethernet as the high-speed, high-quality connectivity exclusive to high-end cars. Rather they look at it as a framework that scales down for high-volume vehicles, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe car industry is absorbing Ethernet like a sponge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0   Ethernet as a backbone in-vehicle network (Source: Marvell) "}
