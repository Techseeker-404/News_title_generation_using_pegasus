The next big step will be a March 26 meeting wherein Qualcomm shareholders will get to vote on whether they want the takeover or not, according to a Reuters report. Broadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort is the latest and largest in a string of deals all about growing by acquisition. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bold approach admired by many, sometimes from a distance. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked with several former Broadcom tech execs in recent weeks who left the company after it pruned R&D, including their projects. A former LSI executive was exploring opportunities in the Internet of Things at the new Broadcom when the project was cut and he decided that it was time to leave. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat they are doing is great financial engineering,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will see a trend of less innovation from large companies, and startups will drive innovation if they can get funded, and then companies like Broadcom will acquire them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Qualcomm has a different model. It pours money into R&D and gets it back through sales of high-end products and licensing its patents. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the latter part that has become the rub. Apple kicked off in January a major rebellion against Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steep licensing fees, a battle still raging. Since then, another unnamed Qualcomm customer has also started pushing back on the fees. Broadcom and its Wall Street advisors see the opportunity to pounce. If they capture the mobile-chip giant, they will no doubt slice and dice it up as they have LSI, the classic Broadcom, and, as they will, Brocade. This will be a historic fight to watch over the next few weeks. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the biggest proposed acquisition in the history of the semiconductor industry. In some ways, it even pales this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat bizarre bid of CVS for Aetna, claiming to reshape health care in America. For now, Broadcom is not increasing its $70/share bid for Qualcomm. Instead, it is turning up the heat with shareholders and customers in a battle for their hearts and minds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have heard from many Qualcomm stockholders who have expressed their desire for Qualcomm to engage with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan in a statement today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also continue to receive positive feedback from customers \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [Broadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed board of director] nominations give Qualcomm stockholders an opportunity to voice their disappointment with Qualcomm\u2019s directors and their refusal to engage in discussions with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Qualcomm was quick to respond with its own statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBroadcom and Silver Lake are effectively asking stockholders to foreclose options and make a decision now on a non-binding proposed transaction, which could not be completed for well over a year, if ever, given the magnitude of regulatory issues, the absence of commitments by Broadcom to resolve those issues, Broadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of committed financing, and the uncertainty surrounding its transition from Singapore to the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said. Expect the war of words to intensify over the next quarter leading to the shareholder meeting, at which time, Hock Tan may sweeten his deal. Meanwhile, the slate of directors that Broadcom proposed below includes several with significant experience in semiconductors or electronics:  Samih Elhage, former president of the mobile networks group at Nokia who also served on the board of Alcatel-Lucent. Raul J. Fernandez, vice chairman of Monumental Sports & Entertainment. Michael S. Geltzeiler, consultant for Temasek Holdings and former CFO of ADT Corp. Stephen J. Girsky, managing partner of VectoIQ, a former vice chair at General Motors who sat on the boards of Drive.ai and Valens Semiconductor. David G. Golden, managing partner at Revolution Ventures who spent 18 years at J.P. Morgan, including five years as its director of technology, media, and telecommunications investment banking. Veronica M. Hagen, retired CEO of Polymer Group, Inc. and held multiple positions at Alcoa. Julie A. Hill, owner of The Hill Company who serves on the board of Anthem Inc. John H. Kispert, managing partner of Black Diamond Ventures and former CEO of Spansion. Gregorio Reyes, former Director and Chairman of the Boards of Dialog Semiconductor plc and LSI Corp. and former Director of Seagate Technologies. Thomas S. Volpe, managing member of Volpe Investments LLC who has served on the board of Linear Technology. Harry L. You, president, CFO, and director of GTY Technology Holdings Inc. and a former EMC Corp. executive.  No doubt that these people will serve Hock Tan in coming weeks by amplifying his message to Qualcomm customers and shareholders in their rolodexes. Let the games begin. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times  Related posts:  Qualcomm, Apple Exchange Fresh Salvos  Apple iPhone X Packs Intel, Q\u00e2\u0080\u0099comm Broadcom Identifies $300M Cuts Broadcom, Qualcomm Groked      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
