CEA-Leti has provided no explanation of Semeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contract non-renewal. Late last month, CEA-Leti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO from 2014 to 2017, announced her decision to take a position as CTO of Total, a French multinational integrated oil and gas company.  Sabonnadiere joins Leti from CEA Tech, where he led the industrial-partnership program. Leti touted Sabonnadiere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong background in new-technology development\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroad private-sector expertise\u00e2\u0080\u009d as qualifications critical to multicultural organizations like Leti pursuing business transformation in Europe and globally. Leti, which employs 1,900 scientists and engineers, has been increasingly active in bridging two worlds\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the more traditional European R&D institutions focused on deep technology development and newer commercial enterprises in the global market that need deep technologies to rapidly enable their ambitious agendas. With a portfolio of 2,700 patents, Leti has launched more than 60 startups thus far. In a statement, Sabonnadiere said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuccess in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demanding international digital landscape requires a combination of deep technological expertise, advanced platforms, a commitment to customer and partner success and a shared excitement and agility about the new opportunities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is where Leti is today, and I am very excited to join this world-class team to develop the solutions that will bring digital innovations to the benefit of leading technology companies around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Most notable in Sabonnadiere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resume is his wealth of executive experience at several European enterprises. Prior to joining CEA, Sabonnadiere was CEO of the Philips Lighting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Business Group Professional in Amsterdam. From 2008 to 2014, he was CEO and chairman of General Cable Europe in Barcelona, and from 2005 to 2008 he served as CEO of NKM Noell in Wurzburg, Germany. Before that, he served as vice president of Alstom T&D for five years. Early in his career, he held multiple positions at Schneider Electric, including managing director of development for equipment units. Sabonnadiere holds a Ph.D. in physics from the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, an MBA degree from Ecole Sup\u00c3\u00a9rieure des Affaires de Grenoble and an engineering degree in information technology from the Universit\u00c3\u00a9 Technologie Compi\u00c3\u00a8gne. Semeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy Prior to the announcement of the new CEA-Leti CEO Tuesday, EE Times had a brief email exchange with Semeria. Speaking of her new position at Total, she wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cExploring the new world of energy and taking the challenge of the big transition to renewable energies and of digital transformation is a new turn in my career.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, for Semeria, the move marks \u00e2\u0080\u009ca comeback to industry after 22 years in Leti and\u00c2\u00a0in public research.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She resolutely expressed her enthusiasm to the new job, calling it \u00e2\u0080\u009ca new challenge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although Semeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contract with CEA-Leti lasted only three years, she made key contributions to the 50-year old French laboratory institute. Among her achievements are a new model of cooperation among CEA Tech, universities, and the National Center for Scientific Research in clusters of projects while strengthening the pre-industrialization phase. She also promoted a culture of entrepreneurship within Leti and CEA Tech, while forging strategic partnerships with commercial enterprises based beyond the French border. During Semeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s term, CEA-Leti signed an R&D agreement with Intel, with a plan for Leti to provide technologies that enable next-generation communication\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 one order of magnitude faster\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the Internet of Things.\u00c2\u00a0 CEA-Leti also became a partner to the Stanford SystemX Alliance. This past June, CEA-Leti announced an agreement to work with the Fraunhofer Group (Berlin), aligning their microelectronics innovation agenda in Europe. At the time of the announcement, Semeria told reporters, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy putting European large projects under a single roof, we can go faster [with our R&D], together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
