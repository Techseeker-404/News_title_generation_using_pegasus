To transform this data into information at the point of creation and need\u2013and to do so more efficiently\u2013processing is increasingly being decentralized, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing an upsurge in the growth of edge-node processing. In 2019, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to see advances in sensors that only wake when something interesting is happening and sift the input to transmit only relevant information to the cloud. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also see greater focus on efficient power management in edge node devices to support the increased processing demands and resultant thermal dynamics challenges. In addition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see greater focus on security as the growing value of the information generated makes loss or corruption costlier. Sensor fusion, the combination of differing sensing modalities to create a more accurate perception of reality, will become increasingly pervasive thanks to a combination of edge-node processing, the fog, and the cloud. It is difficult to imagine a technology more hyped at this point than Artificial Intelligence (AI). Below the breathless excitement, however, real progress is being made as virtually every industry is working to determine the opportunity and potential impact it represents. In automotive for example, rapid advancement in environmental sensing accuracy is fueling progress in both trained and inference-based systems. Automotive AI processing predominantly takes place at the edge rather than in the cloud due to the need for low-latency, real-time decision making. But the architectural battle between edge and cloud computing in AI will be waged on an application-by-application basis as other emerging markets such as gaming and industrial automation have their own needs. Thorny issues remain for all markets, especially in the areas of unsupervised training and validation of how AI systems will really work once they are trained. While we will make advancements in these areas in 2019, non-technical issues like ethics, liability, and governance as well as a limited pool of AI talent remain hurdles to progress. Shifting into High Gear  A triple wave of disruption is hitting the automotive industry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 vehicle electrification, autonomous vehicles, and transport-as-a-service. Vehicle electrification will continue to grow at double digits and migrate from a niche to the mainstream in 2019 as internal combustion engines face increasing regulatory pressure (up to and including banning certain technologies) and electric and power management technologies improve and become less expensive. New chemistries are enabling much greater energy density in batteries, which is spawning innovation in related areas of battery formation and lifecycle management. Advances will be needed to enable measuring, interpreting, and securing communication of state information of the next generation of batteries. In autonomous vehicles, we expect to see additional advances in level 3+ highway autopilot solutions, extensive tests of fleet services, and the fusion of vision, radar and lidar to enable greater situational awareness. Robo-taxis from companies like Baidu and Waymo will bring the next wave of innovation to the transportation-as-a-service market and continue to drive the consumer shift from car ownership to car access. Significant advances in autonomy aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited to the automotive market. Robots, and increasingly, cobots (human-robot pairings) are operating independently of programming as they are equipped with sensors and local, fog, and cloud-based processing power. In 2019, we will see additional advances in the security and safety of autonomous electronics in areas in which humans and robots interact. For example, autonomous robots and cobots able to map their surroundings in 3D through multiple modalities in real time will become increasingly important as they work in close proximity to humans. Healthcare Becomes Prescient  The need for economically viable wellness and healthcare solutions will drive strong growth in the adoption of sensing, computing, and mobile technologies. Deeper diagnostics, miniaturization, and connectivity will be the guideposts on the path to healthcare that is increasingly prescient. We are witnessing the birth of a new healthcare era in which clinical-grade healthcare will be available in non-clinical locations. Biological, gas, and chemical sensors will increasingly provide clinical-grade measurements in form factors and price points that make them more accessible outside of traditional healthcare facilities, making it possible to manage patient diseases in ways that prevent acute events that require expensive hospitalization. In 2019, we will see more clinical-grade consumer devices being used in healthcare regimens as insurance companies, hospitals, and government programs like Medicare start to accept this as a valid way to monitor patients and improve healthcare outcomes. This will drive additional advancements in sensor accuracy and data analysis as at-home devices begin to transition from a recreational novelty to a truly critical element of healthcare. This disruption in healthcare will be supported by advances in 5G, which has been on the horizon for many years and is finally beginning commercial deployment in 2019. The initial roll-out phase of Massive MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) will provide significant improvements over 4G, and eventually, millimeter wave 5G solutions will provide multi-gigabit per second wireless connectivity. As these initial 5G instantiations come online, the impact will be substantial. The advances in connectivity enabled by 5G will extend beyond the internet to drive revolutionary changes in automotive, healthcare and industrial-automation markets. Ultimately, 2019 will evolve in ways we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t predict. Some technologies that seem on the verge of achieving their promise will still be on the verge at the end of 2019. Other technologies will silently reach a tipping point and become part of our everyday experience with hardly a ripple. \u2014Vincent Roche is president and chief executive of Analog Devices, Inc.  "}
