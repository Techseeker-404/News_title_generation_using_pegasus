Once finished, the process \u00e2\u0080\u0094 quietly begun several years ago \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may reduce component distribution to a fraction of Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global sales and push the company deeper into the design chain. It is a transformation born of necessity and emblematic of a conundrum facing the industry. The old challenges of commoditization and margin pressures remain intractable even as new sales opportunities open for distributors, semiconductor suppliers and high-tech equipment manufacturers. The explosive adoption of wireless connectivity (IoT) by most segments of the economy is creating massive sales opportunities in areas once closed to electronics manufacturers but it is also forcing a re-evaluation of the product creation, development, engineering and manufacturing processes and thus, the role of component distributors. But while rival top-tier distributors are tinkering hesitatingly with existing business models, Arrow, instead, seeks a more central role in the value chain. The reason for caution on the part of other distributors is simple; the sector is growing, lifted by a resurgent economy and strong demand for electronics and components. Many distributors are, therefore, more focused on protecting current revenue streams and proceeding with reorganization at a slower pace, according to observers. Arrow is growing, too, well-ahead of industry average (2017 sales are projected to reach $26.6 billion, up 12 percent, from $23.8 billon, in 2016) and it has surged passed rivals to establish a commanding lead of the distribution available market. But executives say the company is also determined to forge ahead with a repositioning of its operations because they believe the old business model is not longer-term viable. So, while the ongoing changes are the latest in a string of industry-leading actions taken by Arrow since it was founded in 1935, they will be the most transformative. Arrow wants to be at the heart of the industry design chain and supply chain, pumping out critical services \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whatever the customer needs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to old and emerging players, Andy King, head of Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s components division, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest operating unit, said. The parts required for this transformation have been acquired and are being deployed, he said. The company has amassed a trove of design, engineering, technical information, media, logistics, supply chain management, production, end-of-life management, enterprise resources, software and IP solutions to service whatever the customer needs and at whatever stage of the product development, manufacturing and introduction process. The customers determine what they want but Arrow will be ready to offer those services immediately, according to company executives.  Andy King, President, Global Components, Arrow Electronics Inc. "}
