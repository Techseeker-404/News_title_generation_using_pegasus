ST also elevated his presumed successor, Chief Operating Officer Jean-Marc Chery, to the position of deputy CEO. On a first quarter earnings call Thursday), Bozotti said he agreed to remain in his position until July 2018. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have accepted the proposal to extend my role as president and CEO for one more year and I am fully committed to driving this company forward, with the support of my deputy CEO, Jean-Marc Chery, and a strong executive team,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bozotti said.  Bozotti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous contract was due to expire next month and the company has reportedly been searching for a replacement. Bozotti, an Italian who has been CEO of ST since 2005, turns 65 this year. The French and Italian governments are both stakeholders in ST, with each holding a 14 percent stake in the firm. There has been speculation that they have failed to agree on whether the new CEO should be French or Italian, with each supposedly vetoing the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choices. Asked whether the creation of a Deputy CEO position was the first step in a new succession plan, Bozotti declined to comment, highlighting instead that Chery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contribution to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turnaround up to now has been \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery important.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chery, who is French, has been with the company since its formation in 1987. As COO, and previously chief technology manager, Chery has managed manufacturing technology and digital products. His new role will give him increased responsibility for sales and marketing. Jerome Ramel, an analyst at investment firm Exane BNP Paribas, told EE Times that the announcement that Bozotti would depart after one more year is not surprising. Ramel said it was known a year ago that ST had hired an executive recruiting firm to find Bozotti\u2019s replacement. But over the course of the year, it became clear that Bozotti would be credited with turning ST around financially, so it was not surprising that ST\u2019s board chose to give him another year, Ramel said. \u201cMy understanding is that the headhunter hasn\u2019t found anyone that the board agreed upon,\u201d Ramel said.
