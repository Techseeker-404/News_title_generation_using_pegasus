But once I got there, I began to realize that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a marker \u00e2\u0080\u0094 most of the work going on in Oulu, as in the rest of the world, is in rolling out 5G, carrying out trials, and figuring out business models and use cases. As the head of Nokia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply chain told us, it is already shipping millions of its Airscale radio access platform for 5G installations in cities around the world.

It would signify something way out in the future, plus a label that can also help get research funding.  Ari Pouttu  Ari Pouttu, professor for dependable wireless at the University of Oulu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for Wireless Communications, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it 5G long-term evolution (LTE), or is it 6G?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that they reluctantly decided to go for the 6G moniker, and the result is more than \u00e2\u0082\u00ac250 million (about $291 million) worth of funding over the next eight years for its flagship 6Genesis project. The project, \u00e2\u0080\u009c6Genesis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the 6G-Enabled Wireless Smart Society & Ecosystem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is focused on the development of wireless technology, exploring the implementation of 5G communication technology and the development of a possible 6G standard. Its main aim is to support industry in bringing the 5G standard to the commercialization stage by carrying out large pilots with a test network and to explore development of essential technology components that could be needed for 6G \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whatever that might be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 targeting areas such as wireless connectivity and distributed intelligent computing. In addition to communication between people, the research will focus on communication between devices, processes and objects.
