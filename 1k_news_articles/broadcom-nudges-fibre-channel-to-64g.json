Emulex is bullish on the prospects for its 64-Gbit/s products, although at least one market researcher characterized the overall market as stable. The Emulex LPe35000 cards and XE601 controller are available today, but they need 64G optical modules that are just starting to sample and PCIe Gen 4 connections that are not yet generally available on x86 servers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the end of 2019 or early 2020, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see production shipments of those things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jeff Hoogenboom, general manager of Broadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Emulex division. Ethernet has been expanding the set of jobs that it handles in computer networks, but Fibre Channel got an uptick recently with the rise of solid-state drive (SSD) arrays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another step coming as SSDs with the NVMe interface get deployed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hoogenboom, noting that the new cards support latencies similar to Ethernet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe new requirements will be just as dramatic because the bottlenecks change with NVMe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Analyst Seamus Crehan of Crehan Research is less upbeat. As he said in an email exchange, he expects Fibre Channel cards to \u00e2\u0080\u009csee revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range in 2018, as it is somewhat of a recovery year for the market. After that, I expect that market revenues will be somewhat stable going forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In part by pushing the next generation aggressively, Emulex hopes to gain share in Fibre Channel from its sole rival QLogic, now part of Marvell. So far, Dell EMC said that it will make the Emulex Gen 7 Fibre Channel cards and controllers available on its PowerEdge servers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll-flash arrays are almost 70% of the market now, weighed down by China, which is about 50%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hoogenboom. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe big shift will happen in China this year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the last two quarters, our 16G share in China rose to over 60% from under 30%, and 16G follows the all-flash systems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo by the end of 2019, new storage systems should be based on SSDs for the most part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For his part, analyst Crehan projects that Fibre Channel cards with speeds of 32G and higher will make up more than half of total Fibre Channel market revenues by 2020.
