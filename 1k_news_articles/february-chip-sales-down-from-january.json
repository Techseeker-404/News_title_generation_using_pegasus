The three-month average for chip sales in February totaled $36.8 billion, down 2 percent from January but up 21 percent compared with February 2017, according to the SIA. It was the 19th consecutive month that the three-month average of sales increased on an annual basis. The SIA said the decline in sales compared with January represented typical seasonal market trends. The SIA reports sales estimates compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization, a group of more than 50 chip makers that pool sales data.  John Neuffer  John Neuffer, the SIA's president and CEO, said chip sales increased year-to-year by double-digit percentages across all major regional markets. \u201cThe Americas stood out once again, with sales increasing nearly 40 percent compared to last year, and sales were up year-to-year across all major semiconductor product categories,\u201d Neuffer said, in a press statement. While sales increased year-to-year across all major regions, they declined on a month-to-month basis in the Americas, China, Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. Sales increased by about 1 percent month-to-month in Europe, according to the WSTS.   \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.  "}
