Broadcom Wednesday (Feb. 21) reduced its offer to $117 billion from $121 billion, saying Qualcomm's new bid for NXP \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which was increased to $44 billion from $38 billion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 transfers value from Qualcomm stockholders to NXP stockholders. Broadcom said its offer would revert to $121 billion if Qualcomm is unable to complete the acquisition of NXP. Qualcomm issued a statement Wednesday that criticized the reduced offer, saying that Broadcom does not understand the value that the NXP acquisition would bring to Qualcomm. The company also stated that Broadcom is \u201cwell aware\u201d that the original bid for NXP \u00e2\u0080\u0094 made in October 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was unlikely to win the approval of NXP shareholders, presumably because NXP's stock price has risen significantly in the 16 months since. \u201cBroadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reduced proposal has made an inadequate offer even worse despite the clear increase in value to Qualcomm stockholders from providing certainty around the NXP acquisition,\u201d the statement read. Qualcomm's board of directors earlier this week voted unanimously for a second time to reject Broadcom's $121 billion acquisition offer following the first meeting between representatives of the companies on the matter. But Qualcomm said at the time it would be willing to have further discussions. The two companies are currently engaged in a proxy fight that may well decide the fate of the proposed acquisition. Broadcom has backed six candidates for seats on Qualcomm's 11-member board. If Broadcom's six candidates win board seats, it would create a voting block large enough to push the board to accept Broadcom's offer. Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to vote on board members at the company's annual meeting on March 6. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
