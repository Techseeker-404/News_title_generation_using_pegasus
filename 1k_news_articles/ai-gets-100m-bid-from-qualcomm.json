China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SenseTime alone talked about taking in $3 billion for its platform, and others gave examples of AI quadrupling productivity and saving lives. The combination of 5G and AI is central to Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corporate strategy in the wake of its failed merger with NXP and slowing smartphone growth. The combination of the two technologies will expand the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s addressable market to a smart internet of things, said chief executive Steve Mollenkopf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe funnel of companies we talk to has widened\u00e2\u0080\u009d to include industrial, automotive, and health-care companies, among others, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, the premier device that collects and controls data is the smartphone where Qualcomm is the leader, but in time, that will change to IoT,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Keith Kressin, senior vice president of product management, adding that the company will unveil a Snapdragon next week with expanded DSP, GPU, and custom blocks for AI. The $100 million fund represents a small slice of more than $1 billion that Qualcomm Ventures has invested to date in more than 150 companies, including China handset maker Xiaomi. Qualcomm was also an early investor in Brain Corp., a developer of autonomous navigation systems. The first investment of the new fund went to AnyVision. The software startup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tools extend traditional image recognition to analyze behaviors to determine, for example, if two people are in conversation. SK Telecom shares Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5G + AI strategy. It aims to launch 5G services in South Korea on Dec. 1 in Seoul and six other cities, focusing in part on services such as computer vision for business customers such as Myunghwa Industry Co. Ltd., an auto parts company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHigh-resolution, multi-angle photos of products on conveyor belts will be sent to the cloud server via 5G mobile routers, and the server\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high-performance AI will instantly scan the photos to check for defective products,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the carrier in a press statement.
