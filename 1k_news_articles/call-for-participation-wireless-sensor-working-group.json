IEEE 1451 is a standard for Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) sensors that contain information such as calibration data in the sensor.     IEEE describes the project as follows:  This project establishes a standard for wireless communication methods and data format for transducers (sensors and actuators). The standard defines a TEDS based on the IEEE 1451\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 concept and protocols to access TEDS and transducer data. It adopts necessary wireless interfaces and protocols to facilitate the use of technically differentiated, existing wireless technology solutions. TEDS contain metadata that facilitate identification and characteristic description of transducers. This standard aims to facilitate data interoperability for sensors and actuators independent of wireless technology used in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Security Systems (CPS) .      Applications for TEDS-based sensors include:  Industrial automation Aviation Healthcare Environmental monitoring Transportation Power grid Smart city   If interested in participating, please contact Kang Lee, IEEE 1451.5 Working Group chair, by March 28, 2018 .    \u00e2\u0080\u0094Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
