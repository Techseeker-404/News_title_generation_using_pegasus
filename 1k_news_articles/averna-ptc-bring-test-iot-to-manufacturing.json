Based in Montreal, Averna\u2019s hardware for testing components and systems will now extend ThingWorx to cover manufacturing of electronic components, subsystems, and systems. Averna has long specialized in RF testing. Adding Averna\u2019s sensor, measurement, and test experience to ThingWorx extends the software by adding test data to manufacturing data through the use of IoT devices. The agreement will make Averna a ThingWorx Platinum Partner. ThingWorx connects to machines used for assembly, automation, and measurement, collecting data that can be used for analyzing and predicting processes to keep them fine-tuned. Data can be used to identify trends and prevent products from going out of tolerance.  Averna is best known as a test-system integrator, building ATE systems for manufacturing. Source: Averna As industrial IoT takes off, machine connectivity is growing. \u201cThrough ThingWorx, we\u2019ll be able to combine test data with manufacturing data, analytics, and machine learning to extract value,\u201d said Benoit Richard, VP of Strategy at Averna, in a conversation with EE Times. \u201cIf you look at the end result of a test,\u201d continued Richard, \u201cit\u2019s often pass/fail. By connecting to ThinkWorx, we\u2019ll be able to provide engineers with data that goes deeper, combining test and manufacturing data to identify yield problems and their causes.\u201d  ThingWorx combines data from sensors and machines to produce manufacturing applications. Source: PTC \u201cPeople want to do things with IoT,\u201d PTC\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Timm, told EE Times. \u201cWith our Averna partnership, ThingWorx will be able to integrate sensor data from IoT devices. Data can be stored in the cloud. Small companies don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to invest in their own storage, just rent it from cloud-computing sources.\u201d According to Timm, ThingWorx users who aren\u2019t software engineers can develop apps called \u201cChevrons\u201d that model manufacturing systems. From those systems, engineers can analyze data and take actions. Software engineers generally develop the lower-level connections to the machine or IoT device. Chevrons typically take a few hours to develop. \u00e2\u0080\u0094Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
