The prized 3.7GHz midband spectrum will allow the winners to push ahead with building out their 5G networks nationally. The size of the bids reflects the reality that while the US is may be ahead of many territories in deploying millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, it has fallen behind in the important mid-band, which is ideal for 5G since it offers huge amounts of bandwidth with better propagation characteristics than mmWave with its shorter range and the need for many more sites to achieve good coverage. In the latter stages, the FCC decided to increase the number of rounds each day and limit each bidding phase to just 20 minutes to speed up the process. The gross proceeds of Auction 107 for just 280 MHz of spectrum in the 3.7 GHz to 3.98 GHz band far exceeded the previous highest value raised, $44.89 billion, in the 2014/15 AWS-3 spectrum auction. Altogether, 5,684 licenses were up for grabs for frequencies that were formerly allocated mostly to satellite operators, who will now migrate to the 4.0 to 4.2 GHz range, with a 20MHz band being used as a guard between the two sets of users. The expected cost of this relocation is $3.3 billion, but the FCC is likely to offer those involved incentive payments that could top $9.7 billion. The next stage of the auction will be the so-called assignment phase, during which the winners \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whose names have not yet been revealed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will be able to bid for frequency\u00e2\u0080\u0093specific licenses. The FCC said Friday it would release details for this phase \u00e2\u0080\u009csoon\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Altogether 57 bidders fought over the 14 sub-blocks in each of 406 so called Partial Economic Areas (PEA) across the US. The FCC stipulated that Block A would comprise 100 MHz in five 20MHz sub-blocks in the 3.7- to 3.8 GHz range. This is widely expected to be the first to obtain clearance once the assignment phase in completed. The B-block also includes 100 MHz, again split into five 20MHz sub-blocks in the 3.8- to 3.9GHz range, while the C block will include the remaining 80 MHz split into four equal sub-blocks. The A block was by far the most desirable,\u00c2\u00a0 competitive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and costly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the bidders, as they will get to offer services perhaps a year ahead of those who gained spectrum in the B and C blocks. According to analysis by Sasha Javid, COO of BitPath and a former executive at the FCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s auction group, the average price per MHz-POP for a Category A license was about $1.31, while that for BC licenses was $1.18 and $0.55 respectively. The average came in at $0.94, exceeding by a factor of just over 4 the $0.217 price per MHz-POP that spectrum sold in last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 successful CBRS auction. As in that auction, Verizon is expected to have spent by far the most amongst the large US carriers, but official figures will only be published once the C-band auction is concluded.\u00c2\u00a0 The assignment phase is expected to take another four to five weeks. Other big bidders are likely to have been AT&T, Comcast and Charter, T-Mobile, Cox Communications, US Cellular and Dish Network. Commenting on the results, the FCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outgoing chairman Ajit Pai said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese results represent a strong endorsement by the private sector of the service rules and transition plan put in place by the FCC to quickly make the C-band a critical part of the 5G rollout in the US. And they vindicate the hard choices the FCC made during the C-band proceeding\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u2026 It would have been easy to delay. But we rightly pushed ahead and overcame every one of those obstacles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
