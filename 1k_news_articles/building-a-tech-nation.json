He was quick to note that it was no self-congratulation of his beloved homeland, at least not entirely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem is, why do we get into so much trouble in the first place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Looking at Portugal today, the reader would be forgiven for attributing Franca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question to the humility of this gentle corner of Western Europe. Emerging from the 2008 global financial crisis, Portugal has engineered higher growth, lower inequality, increased employment, and decreased budget deficit, all the while defying austerity mandates from Brussels. Not that Brussels seemed to mind. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, publicly praised Portugal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeautiful economic progress\u00e2\u0080\u009d in March during a parliamentary meeting with Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Costa.\u00c2\u00a0 But Franca, founder of analog semiconductor design firm Chipidea, is no casual observer of Portugal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national development. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch of the buzz we hear these days about Portugal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bourgeoning tech scene is, of course, wonderful, but we run the risk of believing our own hype and not doing enough to ensure early progress takes root and sprouts future progress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Case in point: Web Summit, deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best tech conference on the planet\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Forbes Magazine and coined \u00e2\u0080\u009cDavos for geeks\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Bloomberg, moved to Lisbon two years ago and has drawn such A-list speakers as Jean Liu of Chinese ride-share and autonomous driving technology company Didi, Brian Krzanich of Intel, and the late Professor Stephen Hawking of Cambridge University, along with prominent venture capitalists and tech media moguls. Yet there seems to have been little subsequent foreign direct investment in research and development into Portugal. Without such investments, the thousands of engineering students that graduate each year from Portugal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top universities must still find work abroad. But more important than talent drain, the absence of a strong engineering base means that a country would remain stuck as a net user  of technology rather than producer . It means that the country would be absent at the table where future technology standards are set, supply chains shaped, and long-lasting structural advantages concretized. Indeed, much of world history proves that, over the long run, not only are producer nations principal drivers of economic growth, they also reap most of the rewards. In an article for national newspaper P\u00c3\u00bablico in 1998, Franca called this power hierarchy a technology league of nations  and advocated that Portugal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial policies ought to facilitate the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise as a technology-producing powerhouse by nurturing an agile, outward-looking, but indigenous research and design talent base. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 FrancaCredit: Painting by Junko Yoshida/EE Times  Speaking of agility, you may have noticed that at ASPENCORE, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been covering a little more ground than usual the last few weeks as we have just concluded our marquee China IC Summit in Shanghai and are busy preparing new ventures. In recognition of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing gravitational pull not only as a global manufacturing mega base but also increasingly the leader in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technology, we are putting together a new conference, the ASPENCORE Double Summits featuring global C-level leaders from both manufacturing and supply chain platforms. Some of the speakers we are expecting: Tyson Tuttle, CEO of Silicon Labs; Jean-Marc Chery, incoming CEO of ST Microelectronics; and Nicky Lu, President of Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. We are also honored to host again Professor Wei Shaojun, President of the IC Design Bureau of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Semiconductor Industry Association, one of the most influential advisory bodies to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial and economic policymakers. We look forward to sharing more details of the Double Summits with you and invite you to join us in sunny and warm Shenzhen this November. Meanwhile, at our North American Head Bureau, our designers are hard at work making our sites more intuitive to navigate and easier to read. Running through our rigorous usability testing are a slightly larger font, a cleaner layout, and a few new discovery modules that will let your curiosity guide you to other corners of the ASPENCORE network. As we peruse our soon-to-be-released biannual Mind of the Engineer survey, we see that our readers are traveling more than ever to collaborate with their colleagues. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we have also included a much-needed mobile refresh so you can just as easily follow your favorite editor on the train, at a boarding gate, or in a caf\u00c3\u00a9. Back in Lisbon, as my generous host dropped me off by Terreiro do Pa\u00c3\u00a7o, I suddenly remembered a favorite childhood TV show. A scientist and secret agent, MacGyver always carried a Swiss Army knife and duct tape and evaded all kinds of sticky situations using the limited resources at his disposal. Over time, the name of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hero became synonymous with creativity and resourcefulness and entered American vernacular speech, such as Gizmodo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2013 article, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow NASA MacGyvered the Crippled Apollo 13 Mission Safely Home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yes, getting in trouble is never comfortable and, in the case of hazardous scientific missions, can quickly turn deadly. But human courage and ingenuity in the face of adversity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 our ability to desenrascar  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have long been decisive factors in our survival and evolution. And that is a worthy foundation to build any nation upon.   As ever, if you have a story tip or suggestion for us, you can write me at victor@aspencore.com  or contact your favorite ASPENCORE editor. Thank you for your support. Victor Gao has joined Arrow Electronics in a corporate executive capacity as of April 15 and has handed over the management of ASPENCORE to an interim Publisher, who will carry on as staunch steward of our firewall along with the entire staff of ASPENCORE. This is in line with our charter as the voice of record for the electronics industry and in furtherance of our commitment to maintain our independence and integrity. An announcement about the interim Publisher will be made soon. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Bolaji Ojo, Editorial Director, ASPENCORE.   "}
