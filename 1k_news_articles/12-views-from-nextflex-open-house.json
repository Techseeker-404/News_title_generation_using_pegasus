The U.S. research center was formed in late 2015 with about $165 million in private and public backing to drive technology that marries flexible substrates, printed circuits, and thinned silicon die. This year, the research center has a few more production systems installed in its 15,000-square-foot facility here (see below) to prototype products and processes. It includes three small labs as well as areas for 3D printing, assembly, and test. The center is working on 28 defense contracts. It also aims to define capabilities that it can transfer to commercial manufacturers such as Flex and Jabil, who are among its partners. Exhibitors and attendees represented a mix of academic, commercial, and defense labs.   "}
