Given Imagination\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minuscule market share in the Chinese smartphone market, the assumption might be that Li\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job is to expand its graphic IP core business in China. Imagination told us that the company's revenue in China was only about $11 million (excluding MIPS) in 2017. This, however, is decidedly a short-sighted view. The real line connecting the dots between Imagination, Leo Li and China is artificial intelligence. The long game Canyon Bridge expects Li and Imagination to play is AI and neural network technologies\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 for which China has a huge appetite and the U.K.-based IP company has big ambitions.
