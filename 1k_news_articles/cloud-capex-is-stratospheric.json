Third-quarter capex spending alone reached an all-time high of $37 billion, easily topping the previous record of just under $33 billion during the fourth quarter of 2018. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs expected the hyperscale operators are having little difficulty weathering the pandemic storm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research. Capital investments registered double-digit growth during the first nine months of 2020, with construction and equipping of sprawling data centers up 18 percent over the previous year. The top spenders were Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Facebook. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Alibaba and Tencent along with Apple were among the mid-tier spenders followed by IBM, Oracle, the Chinese e-commence giant JD.com, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NTT and others.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs these companies go from strength to strength they need an ever-larger footprint of data centers to support their rapidly expanding digital activities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dinsdale added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is good news for companies in the data center ecosystem who can ride along in the slipstream of the hyperscale operators.\u201d Synergy Research estimates the number of hyper-scale data centers around the globe grew to 573 by the end of September 2020. In aggregate, the 20 largest operators generated revenues totaling $1.1 trillion in the first three quarters of last year, up 15 percent over 2019. Record spending by cloud providers on data center construction reflects the likely irreversible shift toward remote work and, for now, education. Cloud vendors are scrambling to provide infrastructure, platform, and software tools along with search and e-commerce services. Those pandemic-driven factors are also generating a ripple effect that goes beyond server processor vendors like Intel Corp. and AMD to include networking and other sectors of the data center ecosystem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn industry trend we have seen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is the growth of hyper-scale networking driven by increasing demand for cloud services,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Murugesan Shanmugaraj, president and CEO of optical interconnect vendor Acacia Communications Inc. Acacia moved last week to terminate a $2.8 billion merger agreement with Cisco Systems announced in July 2019. A Cisco lawsuit and Acacia countersuit ensued in a Delaware court. Likely in search of a better offer, Shanmugaraj emphasized during a conference call this week: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAcacia is a stronger company today than we were in 2019.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One reason is surging demand for cloud services, a trend that is likely to continue as the pandemic wears on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe cloud market responds well to uncertainty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d concludes Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360 Research.
