TV has been a godsend during the pandemic. And a curse. Well, a lot of cursing. The latest aggravation was the volume assault when the commercials interrupted The Mandalorian and ratcheted the volume so high that the neighbors five floors below could hear them, too. It was even worse on Missouri State Lady Bear basketball games via ESPN+, which makes sense, since sports content always seems to be shouting. Someone must\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve offered the medical center advertiser decibels on the dollar.  I began watching the TV with the remote within inches of my trigger finger, which was ready to pounce as soon as commercials blared. Before this recent sound inflation, I would keep the commercials on as background noise and might have absorbed a message point or two about the products being peddled, but not anymore: I began passing the time during commercial breaks in blissful silence, completely unreceptive to the messaging that subsidized the content. This is a recent issue. Something changed over the past few weeks and the auditory assault forced me into mute mode. I could blame my cat, who has amazing dexterity and a wickedly playful side, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Mulligan has mastered the audio controls on my AV system \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 yet. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so much that I wanted someone to blame; I just wanted to level the playing field. I started with Sony because the TV was sending out the audio signal. In fairness, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it was the TV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been here for about four years, and this hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been a problem in the past. Still, I wanted to see what Sony had to say about volume mismatches, so I Googled. In a search result, Sony passed the buck: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost TV commercials are created to be loud simply so you can hear the advertisement and get your attention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (I wonder what the Sony ad department thinks about that). It went on to say that the Federal Communications Commission doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t regulate the volume of commercials, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor does it regulate the volume of TV programs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It does, however, require broadcasters to limit the power used to transmit the signal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, technically, a commercial cannot be any louder than the loudest portion of the TV program you are watching.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ha! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to invite Sony to my house. The TV maker had a few fixes because apparently this issue comes up a lot. Some Sony TVs have a helpful feature called Steady Sound volume control. If mine did, I could set it to \u00e2\u0080\u009con\u00e2\u0080\u009d and fix the problem. Maybe, that is, because on \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertain model TVs, the Steady Sound feature may only works [sic] when the RF input is being used; for some models it work [sic] with composite, component or HDMI inputs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That sounds iffy at best. In any case, my TV doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have Steady Sound so scratch that one. Solution 2 is for TVs with Advanced Auto Volume. Ding, ding, ding! My TV has Advanced Auto Volume! But when I looked closer, it was grayed out. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because AAV only works if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the TV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal speakers. My TV is connected to a Sonos sound bar. Strike two. Option 3 said to turn off features that are supposed to improve the wimpy sound that comes from a flat-panel TV \u00e2\u0080\u0093 things like SRS, WOW or TruSurround. So much for enhanced sound. Strike three. Fix 4 was my favorite, the fail-safe, and the one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been using for weeks: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the previous options are not available on your TV, use the MUTE or MUTING button on the TV remote control.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A TV company telling you just to watch, not listen. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still chuckling over that one. I watch most TV these days through a Roku player so that was my next stop. After all, Roku feeds the audio and video signals to the TV. That search brought up a post from RokuTannerD from the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community support page. It was \u00e2\u0080\u009cLevel 19\u00e2\u0080\u009d support. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s considered important or not: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in levels 1-18, and 20 and higher? Tanner passed the buck, too, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontent source audio formatting/leveling is determined by each channel provider themselves. If you are running into an issue with audio inside a particular channel, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to contact that channel provider directly to report the issue, and specify the content or specific commercials/ads that you experienced the issue with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get right on that because I know that rows of operators at ESPN+ are standing by to take my call so that I can complain about the volume levels of commercials that pay their salaries (For giggles, though, I tried to log in to do that but ESPN prompted me for my email address and password, which, of course, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to look up.) After blaming advertisers, Tanner suggested a fix involving the on-screen menu using\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cvolume modes\u00e2\u0080\u009d that are supported on select Roku players. The feature can be accessed from the left-hand menu, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTry enabling \u00e2\u0080\u0098Leveling\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to see if this helps reduce the volume level inconsistency,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he advised a customer in the forum. That actually worked. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not perfect; commercials are still a bit louder than the programs, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far better than it was, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to keep a death grip on the remote while relaxing in front of the telly. So now that the volume is solved, can we work on the dialog?     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
