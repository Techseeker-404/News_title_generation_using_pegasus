Apparently, Elektrobit (Erlangen, Germany), a leading embedded software supplier for the automotive industry, saw this coming. The company unveiled Wednesday \u00e2\u0080\u009can industry first software platform\u00e2\u0080\u009d called EB xelor. The software platform is designed for car OEMs and tier ones to accelerate development of next-generation automotive architecture. EB xelor consists of production-proven software from Elektrobit, in addition to open-source and third-party software. EB xelor is a collection of foundational software \u2014 mostly non-differentiating \u2014 that OEMs and tier ones can simply pick up and turn on, instead of chewing up time and engineering resources to reinvent someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wheel. EB xelor, thus, frees up OEMs\u2019 time, allowing them to focus more on developing their own differentiating software.

(Source: Elektrobit) He also explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese foundational software pieces [made available on EB xelor] have been independently developed, integrated and maintained\u00e2\u0080\u00a6[but] we are making sure they all work together, and we will maintain them for the next 10 to 15 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Egil Juliussen, a veteran automotive analyst, told EE Times that EB xelor reminds him of how chip designers build a complex SoC by leveraging reusable IP blocks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cElektrobit is offering \u00e2\u0080\u0098software of SoC.\u00e2\u0080\u009d EB xelor: Under the hood EB xelor essentially is an integrated software package consisting of EB products, third-party software and open-source components. Included in the EB xelor platform are:  a high-performance functional safety software stack based on Linux and Adaptive AUTOSAR a real-time and safety software stack based on Classic AUTOSAR EB tresos \u2014 a hypervisor software for high-performance automotive SoC updates  Two automotive SoCs the EB xelor platform currently targets are chips from NXP and Renesas. Elektrobit offers system-level validation on these SoCs. Car makers can then add vehicle-specific software to these stacks, Elektrobit explained. The EB xelor software platform also includes \u00e2\u0080\u009chealth management capabilities, along with tools and services to automate builds and facilitate integration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Elektrobit.

Asked to explain Linux (safe), Elektrobit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Seidel said it will be open-source Linux tailored to such safety standards as IEC 61508 and ISO 26262. Elektrobit is working with SUSE in hopes of making Linux (safe) available globally for OEMs in 2021. Complexity drivers. (Source: Elektrobit) Click the image to enlarge. Elektrobit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 VW Elektrobit understands that any car OEMs could use a foundational platform like EB xelor. This is because when carmakers move away from legacy vehicles to an advanced vehicle platform based on consolidated, central high-performance controllers, they must write not only oodles of new code, but also integrate lots of open-source oodles. The collaborators in any such software project are a car OEM, a tier one and a lot of third-party software developers. Elektrobit saw an example when it worked with VW whose ID.3 was its first full electric vehicle with several high-performance ECUs. Elektrobit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Seidel acknowledged that his company worked with VW on developing software for highly consolidated ECUs that range from body controller/gateway and infotainment to the on-board communication unit and transceiver module. Business model Elektrobit is licensing EB xelor within the automotive industry.
