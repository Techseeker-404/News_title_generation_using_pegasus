The group expects sales to grow by another 7.5 percent next year. SEMI said it now expects sales for fab tools to reach a record $55.9 billion this year, passing the $50 billion mark for the first time. The earlier forecast, issued in June, had predicted sales of $49.4 billion, which itself would have been a record. This year\u2019s semiconductor equipment buying spree, fueled by capacity expansion and record chip sales, is expected to shatter the sales record set way back in 2000, at the height of the dot com bubble. Sales of wafer processing equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the largest category of semiconductor equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are expected to grow by 37.5 percent to reach $45 billion, SEMI said. Sales of other front-end equipment, including mask and reticle inspection equipment, is expected to increase by 46 percent to reach $2.6 billion, SEMI said.  SEMI said it expects assembly and packaging equipment sales to grow 26 percent to reach $3.8 billion and test equipment sales to grow 22 percent to $4.5 billion. South Korea remains on pace to become the largest geography for fab tool sales for the first time this year, SEMI said. Taiwan is expected to be the second largest geography, while China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where sales are expected to grow by 49 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is expected to be the third largest geography for sales, SEMI said. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
