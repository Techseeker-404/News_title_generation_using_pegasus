The weeklong hackfest aims to raise the profile of software-defined radio (SDR) and explore new possibilities for it in military and commercials markets. The event was organized by Tom Rondeau, program manager in the microsystems department of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Before joining DARPA last year, Rondeau spent six years leading GNU Radio, an open source framework for SDR. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA software radio can be cellular, Wi-Fi, anything based on how you program it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all math and numerical processing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rondeau said. He described GNU Radio as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca domain specific language for signal processing to develop demodulators, filters and transmitters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty complete tool set used by R&D groups all around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Outcomes of the hackfest may vary from helping soldiers jam enemy communications to opening airwaves for the billions of wireless devices expected on the emerging Internet of Things. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet enough drones tougher and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a spectrum crunch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rondeau. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed swarms with off-the-shelf radios that can only sustain 50 drones in a geographical area because they run out of spectrum, so in 10-15 years if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have a trillion wireless devices we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need something smarter than another Wi-Fi chip set,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe teams are prepped to think about the link between ground control and drones as software definable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6so they may find new modes of operation you can only think of working at computer speed\u2026think of the drone as a programmable extension of the computer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChanges in how we use drones may come out of this, but while the event is focused on drones, my intent is to get people interested in software radio, programming spectrum and applying new knowledge about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.
