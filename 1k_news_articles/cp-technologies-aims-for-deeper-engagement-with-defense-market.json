The company, which provides ruggedized computer hardware systems, servers, and LCD displays points to its defense market roots, which it intends to further grow. The moniker better represents the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on serving those in harsh military and industrial environments. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe wanted to communicate that our brand is combat proven, since that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing for 20 years, sending ruggedized computers into combat environments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mike McCormack, president of CP Technologies. At the same time, the military and defense markets are offering more opportunity for suppliers hoping to grow a foothold with manufacturers in the sector. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor many years, defense primes were manufacturers of hardware, as well as service and integration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCormack explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat has become more difficult with the complexity of weapons platforms and the breadth of capability it takes to be everything from building aircraft technology, and servicing and support to manufacture that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More and more these contractors have turned to commercial off the shelf (COTS) offerings, he added.\u00c2\u00a0 CP Technologies is moving toward this new \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplete solution\u00e2\u0080\u009d focus in order to meet the needs of its military customers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe found a niche market in ruggedized COTS solutions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said McCormack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to provide complete, integrated portable solutions and complete rack solutions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These customers are trying to address to high cost of customized products, as well as challenges with achieving cross-platform compatibility, he added. Image courtesy: CP Technologies   \u00c2\u00a0 These systems will include Portable Computing Systems (PCS), Small Tactical Transit Case (STTC), Medium Tactical Transit Case (MTTC) and Complete Rack Solutions (CRS). CP will also continue to provide the separate components that it has offered in the past.\u00c2\u00a0 Complete solutions offer a variety of benefits, especially reducing the cost and complexity of ongoing service and support of systems. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the Department of Defense (DoD), you have a software system that is configured around hardware and that is continuously changing so there is continual ongoing cost to maintaining it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said McCormack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy maintaining stable revision control, they can greatly reduce the cost of maintaining systems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition to ensuring that compatibility and revision control is maintained, CP Technologies will be certifying that its products comply with the Trade Agreements Act (TAA). \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are driving more to TAA compliance and the need for it because they are concerned with intellectual property (IP) theft by adversaries, both China and Russia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCormack said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are acutely aware of making sure our sources of supply are TAA compliant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Late last year, CP Technologies (then Chassis Plans) was acquired by Aeronautics Ltd. of Israel, a move which started the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey toward its latest evolution. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe acquisition of Chassis Plans by Aeronautics is allowing the natural evolution of the company into CP Technologies through investment that allows it to expand its R&D, product offering and marketing activities on worldwide basis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCormack said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will incorporate a broader offering of product, complete integrated solutions, and the addition of data links that give our customers a broader product choice as well as a complete solution instead of just components.\u00e2\u0080\u009d      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
