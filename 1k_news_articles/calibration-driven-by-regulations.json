Manufacturers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially those making medical, pharmaceutical, military, and aerospace products \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t risk \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalse positives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d measurements that let defective products into the market. The same goes for false negatives, which result in good products not shipping or, worse, being scrapped.    To keep your test equipment within specifications, you need to calibrate it. Large companies such as defense contractors may have calibration facilities in-house, but most companies use third-party labs such as Transcat. EE Times visited the company headquarters to get a first-hand look at the facilities and equipment in a high-end calibration lab. While I was there, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resist bringing an HP34401A DMM in for a checkup. The meter had not been to a lab in 10 years.    According to Transcat CEO Lee Rudow, 45% of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business comes from calibrating equipment used in the manufacture of medical and pharmaceutical equipment such as thermometers and humidity meters. Other calibrations include flow and dimensional work. For example, a medical-device manufacturer who makes artificial limbs must make dimensional measurements using lasers. Transcat will calibrate the mechanical measuring equipment used in such manufacturing.    [See companion article EDN visits a calibration lab for an actual calibration of a digital multimeter]    Calibrations of equipment for electrical measurements such as oscilloscopes and multimeters often come to the lab from the aerospace and defense sector, driven by FAA regulations. The company also performs RF calibrations, centered around its Houston facility, run by Chris Grachanen. Chris has been an advocate for calibration technician training and certification long before Transcat acquired his lab from HP a few years ago.    Rudow explained one reason why Transcat acquired HP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Houston RF calibration lab. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedical devices that enter the body have RF capabilities such as Bluetooth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose products need to be tested with calibrated equipment. Houston also has a standards lab that can calibrate the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 120 Fluke multi-function calibrators to NIST-traceable standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Transcat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calibration standards go beyond electrical qualities of voltage, current, and resistance to include physical quantities such as pressure, temperature, and mass. The Transcat standards for mass are located in temperature-controlled rooms in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. These standards are used as references to compare weights used by customers. (See the following pages\u00e2\u0080\u0099 photos of Transcat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s test equipment at the Rochester facility, which also includes electrical and physical calibrations.)    Because calibration is so regulated, labs need accreditation. Organizations such as National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) regularly audit labs to verify their compliance to recognized practices. In addition, all Transcat technicians receive training and certification.    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want all technicians to be proficiency-tested so that every tech meets requirements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rudow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just have one technician demonstrate to accreditation bodies that we know how to calibrate, even though that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough for lab certification. Having every calibration technician at every facility certified gives us consistency across our 21 locations. If a customer has several locations, they can use the local Transcat lab and get the same calibration as would be done at any other Transcat lab.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    The following pages take you through what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find at Rochester lab.
