Both Apple and Amazon, as well as server vendor Super Micro Inc., issued statements Thursday that strongly refuted the report, which said the attacks were first discovered in 2015. The Bloomberg report  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 based on interviews with 17 people, including two Amazon Web Services insiders, three Apple insiders and six U.S. government officials \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the U.S. is still conducting a top-secret investigation of the incidents more than three years later. Investigators have determined that the chips let attackers create a stealth doorway into any network that included the compromised servers, according to the report. Sources told Bloomberg that the chips \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about the size of a grain of rice and not part of the servers' original design \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China. The attacks were made on servers sold by Supermicro, according to the report. The report comes at a time when tensions between the U.S. and China are high. The world's two largest economies are currently embroiled in a \u00c2\u00a0trade war, and the U.S. has accused China of involvement in hacking and cybercrimes, including the recent suggestion by U.S. President Donald Trump that China is interfering in the U.S. election process. Most allegations of espionage-related security breaches involve remote hackers gaining access to networks and systems through operating systems and other software. The allegations in the Businessweek story are unusual because they involve the physical placement of an IC on a board by a government agency. Super Micro, based in San Jose, Calif., said it \u201cstrongly refutes reports that servers it sold to customers contained malicious microchips in the motherboards of those systems.\u201d Super Micro went on to say it \u201chas never found any malicious chips, nor been informed by any customer that such chips have been found.\u201d Apple said it has been contacted by Bloomberg multiple times with claims of alleged security incidents. The company said it has conducted rigorous internal investigations which have not yielded any evidence to support the claims. \u201cOn this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, 'hardware manipulations' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server,\u201d Apple said in a statement \u201cApple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident. We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI, nor are our contacts in law enforcement.\u201d Amazon said there were \u201cmany inaccuracies\u201d in the Bloomberg article. The article stated that Amazon discovered the implanted chips when it was working with Elemental Technologies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which it later acquired \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in 2015, after Elemental sent several servers to a third-party tech security firm, which discovered the tiny chips. Amazon said Thursday that the third-party's report did not identify any issues with modified chips or hardware, but instead made some typical recommendations for shoring up security that Amazon implemented prior to finalizing the deal to buy Elemental. Bloomberg, Amazon said, has admittedly never seen the results of the report from the third-party vendor. \u201cAmazon employs stringent security standards across our supply chain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 investigating all hardware and software prior to going into production and performing regular security audits internally and with our supply chain partners,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cWe further strengthen our security posture by implementing our own hardware designs for critical components such as processors, servers, storage systems, and networking equipment.\u201d [ Partner Content: Learn how Invisible ultraviolet and infrared light holds great promise as a key to resolving many social and environmental problems]      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
