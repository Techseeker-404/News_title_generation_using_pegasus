Jeff Welser, vice president at IBM Research, says the organization has hit several AI milestones in the past year and is predicting three key areas of focus for 2019. Bringing cognitive solutions powered by AI to a platform businesses can easily adopt is a strategic business imperative for the company, he said, while also increasing understanding of AI and addressing issues such as bias and trust. When it comes to advancing AI, Welser said there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been progress in several areas, including comprehension of speech and analyzing images. IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Project Debater work has been able to extend current AI speech comprehension capabilities beyond simple question answering tasks, enabling machines to better understand when people are making arguments, he said, and taking it beyond just \u00e2\u0080\u009csearch on steroids.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One scenario involved asking a question that had no definitive answer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether government should increase funding for telemedicine.

Rather than requiring thousands or possibly millions of labeled images to train a visual recognition model, IBM has demonstrated it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now possible for AI to recognize new objects with as little as one example as a guideline, which makes AI scalable.

IBM researchers have developed a framework and algorithm to enable AI agents to exchange knowledge, thereby learning significantly faster than previous methods. In addition, he said, they can learn to coordinate where existing methods fail. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have a more complex task, you don't have to necessarily train a big system,\u201d Welser said. \u201cBut you could take individual systems and combine them to go do that task.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Progress is also being made in reducing the computational resources necessary for deep learning models. In 2015, IBM outlined how it was possible to train deep learning models using 16-bit precision, and today 8-bit precision is now possible without compromising model accuracy across all major AI dataset categories, including image, speech, and text. Scaling of AI can also be achieved through a new neural architecture search technique that reduces the heavy lifting required to design a network. All this progress needs to be tempered by the fact AI must be trustworthy, and Welser said there will be a great deal of focus on this in the next year. Like any technology, AI can be subject to malicious manipulation, so it needs to be able to anticipate adversarial attacks. Right now, AI can vulnerable to what are called \u00e2\u0080\u009cadversarial examples,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where a hacker might imperceptibly alter an image such to fool a deep learning model into classifying it into any category the attacker desires. IBM Research has made some progress addressing this with an attack-agnostic measure to evaluate the robustness of a neural network and direct systems on how to detect and defend against attacks. Another conundrum is neural nets tend to be black boxes in that how they come to a decision is not immediately clear, Welser. This lack of transparency is a barrier to putting trust in AI. Meanwhile, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also important to eliminate bias as AI is increasingly relied on to make decisions, he said, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenging. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUp to now we've seen mostly that people have been just so excited to design AI systems to be able to do things,\u201d Wesler said. \u201cThen afterwards they try and figure out if they're biased or if they're robust or if they've got some issue with the decisions they're making.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related Articles:   IBM Speeds Up Machine Learning ARM Unveils New AI Group Power 9 May Dent x86 Servers Intel/Saffron AI Plan Sidesteps Deep Learning AI Expands Role in Design      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
