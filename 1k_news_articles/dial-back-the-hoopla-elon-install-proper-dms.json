While tragic, this has been happening since the dawn of time. In recognition of the incredibly inventive ways that some folk find to remove themselves from the gene pool, we have the Darwin Awards. What is new is the irresponsible use of automated driving technology on public roadways by stupid people recklessly endangering the lives of others. This link shows recent footage of a Tesla operating on Autopilot with no one in the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, making it clear to see the ineffectiveness of the steering wheel torque sensor to monitor driver engagement. Writing about the incident on Twitter, Missy Cummings, a professor at Duke University and director of Duke\u2019s Humans and Autonomy Laboratory commented: \u201cWhat I really love about this video is the one guy in the back seat with his mask on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I will use this in class to illustrate people\u2019s inconsistent risk tolerance\u2026and of course, how people abuse such technologies\u201d Elon Musk probably doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about anything Cummings says, and since Tesla has now disbanded its PR department, it is reasonable to conclude that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care what anyone says. Which is unfortunate because many people are suddenly paying a lot of attention to some pesky Brits and to their latest research on Tesla and Autopilot. Men in Thatch grade Autopilot as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoderate\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t previously heard of UK-based Thatcham Research, you have now. Established by the UK motor insurance industry to help reduce the cost of insurance claims while maintaining safety standards, Thatcham has been making headlines recently following the inaugural publication of its \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssisted Driving Grading\u00e2\u0080\u009d assessments. Further details are provided in this video.   Tabulated results of the first ten vehicles assessed and graded by Thatcham, including the Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, are shown below. As we can see the Model 3 ranked highest in Thatcham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of vehicle assistance and safety backup, but lowest for driver engagement, resulting in the overall grading of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoderate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Click the table above to enlarge. (Source: Thatcham Research) Thatcham is also a member of Euro NCAP (New Car Assessment Program) and its assessment is now the official position of Euro NCAP, meaning it directly influences new car purchasing decisions by European consumers. The full analysis is presented here. The comments include: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system name Autopilot is inappropriate as it suggests full automation. The promotional material suggests automation where the handbook correctly indicates the limitations of the system capabilities, which could lead to confusion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the Tesla is equipped with an internal camera, it is not used for Driver Monitoring relying only on steering wheel input for driver engagement. The system resists driver steering input and then disengages, limiting co-operative driving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Translation: Dial back the hoopla Elon and install proper DMS. A recent story in Teslarati discussed activation of the internal camera in the Model 3 and Model Y and revealed details of Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driver categorizations. With names including \u00e2\u0080\u009cblinded\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it is evident the internal camera does not have any infrared (IR) illumination and does not function reliably in direct sunlight or darkness. While Tesla undoubtedly gained an early competitive advantage with Autopilot, the ineffectiveness of the steering wheel torque sensor to monitor driver engagement and the limited optical range of the internal camera are both technical challenges which cannot be overcome with over-the-air updates. The most effective solution is the installation of a vision-based driver monitoring system (DMS), which is the direction that almost every other automaker is already heading in. So much innovation in DMS The rear-view mirror is emerging as a key integration point for DMS into future mass-market vehicles. Continental\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Interior Camera System (ICAM) integrates an automotive-grade IR optical path suitable for DMS inside the rear-view mirror itself; Gentex provides a similar offering and other suppliers will follow. Continental\u2019s Interior Camera System (Source: Continental) By positioning the DMS image sensor and IR illuminators behind the mirror glass, integration of the optical components is greatly simplified, with space and packaging costs also reduced. This is particularly important for high-volume, mass-market models where the bill-of-materials must be minimized, but performance cannot be compromised entirely without sacrificing a Euro NCAP five-star rating. The raw video signal from the DMS image sensor inside the mirror will be fed to the nearby vision processor in the rear-view mirror assembly. Today this is the ADAS front-camera processor typically supplied by Intel/Mobileye, Xilinx and Renesas, as well as other suppliers such as NXP, Texas Instruments and Toshiba. We can understand more of the technical challenges and design constraints in the video below, discussing the collaboration between Subaru and Xilinx for the second-generation Eyesight system in the Levorg.  In many future vehicles the vision processor in the rear-view mirror assembly will be required to process video feeds from both the ADAS cameras and DMS image sensor. Xilinx is already a key competitor to Mobileye in ADAS processors and my research suggests it is emerging as an early leading supplier of integrated ADAS/DMS vision processing. This is primarily the result of the work Xilinx has accomplished with Seeing Machines to integrate DMS and ADAS algorithms in the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. Xilinx is also the manufacturer of Seeing Machines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 standalone Fovio DMS processor. Another trend I am following is the availability of licensable DMS ASIC cores for integration into SoCs, microcontrollers and microprocessors, most likely by NXP, Renesas, Texas Instruments and Toshiba. The complex technical challenges of DMS integration into the rear-view mirror assembly open up key design-win opportunities for these companies to erode Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing dominance in ADAS vision processing. Possibly the most exciting DMS development I am investigating involves Qualcomm. I have previously reported on my interpretation of the Qualcomm-Veoneer partnership and have speculated on the possibility of a future eye-gaze controlled version of Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Android Automotive OS. However this announcement from OpenSynergy of a collaboration with Google and Qualcomm on a virtualized Android Automotive OS might suggest plans for a combined ADAS/infotainment domain controller running the Google and Veoneer software together on the same Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC. Such a solution could solve automakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 aesthetic, regulatory and technical challenges for ADAS, DMS and smartphone distraction all at the same time. Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 Snapdragon Tech Summit is coming on December 1-2, so I will be watching closely and will report back when more is known. The saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change\u00e2\u0080\u009d is often attributed to Charles Darwin but in fact comes from Leon Megginson. Mobileye, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Tesla look set to square-off for an explosive battle in automotive domain controllers, each with a product strategy clearly different from the others. However, so far only Qualcomm seems to have adapted to the change in the importance of DMS and driver engagement among automotive advisory and regulatory bodies. Looking ahead, this is going to be a fascinating battle to watch.      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
