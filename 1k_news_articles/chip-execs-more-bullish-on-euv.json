The new systems will help drive advances at a time when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming increasingly complex and expensive to make leading-edge devices. Seventy-five percent of a survey of 75 semiconductor luminaries said that they expect that EUV will be adopted in high-volume manufacturing before 2021. Only 1% said that EUV will never be embraced, down from 6% last year and a whopping 35% in 2014. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question in my mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d EUV will be adopted starting with 7-nm+ processes in the next few years, said Aki Fujimura, an industry veteran and spokesman for the eBeam Initiative, a trade group that conducted the survey over the summer. Intel, Samsung, and TSMC made multi-billion-dollar investments in EUV developer ASML, which, in turn, bought light-source maker Cymer, driving the complex and expensive technology forward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the last couple of years, the problem got bad enough with 7 and 5 nm that everyone finally said that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to make this work or the entire industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Fujimura, who is chief executive of D2S, a vendor of GPU acceleration products for mask making.

Chip makers are expected to launch 7-nm processes with existing immersion steppers, then migrate some steps to EUV later to reduce the need for multi-patterning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEUV is so novel and requires so much investment in the machine and ecosystem to support it that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a stepwise introduction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Fujimura, who is on his third startup after a career in EDA that started in 1979 and included two tours at Cadence Design Systems. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to introduce it more gradually than that \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [and not] ask EUV to do its best right off the bat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Over the past 12 months, mask makers created 1,041 EUV masks, up from 382 a year ago. EUV mask yields were only 64.3%, compared to 94.8% for all 462,792 masks exposed in the period, according to a separate survey of 10 top mask makers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI attribute [the low figure] to startup yields \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 one might say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprising that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as high as 64.3%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.
