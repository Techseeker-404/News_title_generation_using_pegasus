One, in particular, is TCO Development. This well-known Swedish non-profit has a lengthy history of focusing on improving the sustainability of IT products through the development of standards, and certification and labeling of compliant products. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably seen the TCO label on monitors and other equipment over the years. TCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product scope overlaps with EPEAT to an extent but covers a broader range of data-center equipment as well as other product categories (e.g., projectors and headsets). TCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criteria covers many of the same areas as EPEAT and expands in others, like socially and environmentally responsible manufacturing. While there are common criteria across all TCO Certified standards, focusing on TCO Generation 8 for Servers, the following criteria (and more) could \u00e2\u0080\u0094 along with the EPEAT criteria identified last month \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also be considered for manufacturers of nearly any type of electronic product (or a product that contains electronic components): Most of these are relevant for circularity and all represent solid starting (and maybe end) points. However, I spend a lot of my time dealing with chemicals in electronics and I feel that the industry, and subsequently EPEAT and TCO, focuses on too narrow a set of chemical substances, as well as inadequately addressing the issue of regrettable substitutions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and industry; governments usually fail to deal with the substitution of substances they ban. Halogenated flame retardants are being banned from display, TV and monitor enclosures and their stands in the European Union because they contaminate the recycling stream. For instance, they continue to show up as contaminants in products like kitchen utensils (but less than they used to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so perhaps we are making progress). Both EPEAT and TCO Certified standards ban these halogenated flame retardants as well. Replacing them with phosphorus-based flame retardants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which are the most common alternative technology for most halogenated flame retardant applications \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will simply result in the kitchen utensils containing a different, and still unnecessary (and potentially toxic and problematic for this unintended use) flame retardant. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not aware of any studies of phosphorus-based flame retardants in kitchen utensils yet. The rest of the composition of plastic resins intended for use in electronic products merit strong consideration as well. Some of the substances used to meet technical and functional requirements for electronics may also be unnecessary, undesirable, or even dangerous for a kitchen utensil that has to meet food contact material substance requirements. Why, though, would resin composition for an electronic product enclosure also have to meet requirements for food contact material? Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this complicate and narrow the safe design space too much? I think it does. But until the electronics industry invests in a closed-loop recycling and material recovery system that prevents recycled electronic-grade materials from entering material streams destined for food-grade products, this constraint will continue to exist. TCO does deserve credit, though, for going to the next level. For certain categories of substances, namely flame retardants and plasticizers, TCO has produced a list of \u00e2\u0080\u009csafer alternatives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Note the use of the term \u00e2\u0080\u009csafer\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Given the ever-expanding information and insight being developed by toxicologists and other scientists about a wide range of industrial chemicals, saying something is \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe\u00e2\u0080\u009d today is dangerous; all we can do is to get better \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be perfect today. TCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list is, in fact, dynamic and subject to change. TCO and GEC (the organization responsible for EPEAT standards) know what mountain the flag sits atop. And they know how far away we are from that goal. TCO has been at it for 25 years; GEC for over 15. This journey takes time and patience. An interesting webinar will be held on March 18, 2020. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) along with a number of other industry and non-industry organizations (including the above-mentioned GEC) is holding a webinar called \u00e2\u0080\u009cCircular Electronics Partnership: from Roadmap to Action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They say they have spent the past year developing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cVision and Roadmap for Circular Electronics\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Coincidentally, this column has been around for the past year too \u00e2\u0098\u00ba. I take no credit, of course, and, being a mere consultant, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not privy to their work so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to learning how far off the mark I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in these columns! Sign up here. Perhaps I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just found the topic for next month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s column.
