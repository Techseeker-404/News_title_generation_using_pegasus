After years of delays, cost overruns and several near-death experiences, NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s James Webb Space Telescope may finally be headed to the launch pad. A key milestone was reached in mid-December when prime contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. finally managed to demonstrate a crucial deployment step: the unfurling of the telescope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tennis-court-size sunshield. The kite-shaped umbrella reflects Sun- and Earthlight, maintaining the extremely cold operating temperature required for the space telescope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infrared sensor. The first unfurling and tensioning test in 2018 failed when components as simple as screws came loose, further delaying a project originally scheduled to be on-orbit several years ago. Despite the successful unfurling test, the pandemic has caused the launch date to again slip from this coming March to no earlier than October 2021. After years of budget busts, Congress capped Webb telescope funding at $8.8 billion. The space agency insists a steady stream of snafus won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add to the cost, but recent budget projections put the price tag closer to $9.7 billion. Once the Webb telescope reaches its intended orbit at a gravitational parking space known as a Lagrange Point 1 million miles from Earth, it will take six months and about 180 maneuvers to unfold the hexagonal segments of its 6.5-meter (21 foot) main mirror and unfurl the sunshield. Any failure in this daisy chain will likely result in a very expensive and useless space sensor. At such distances, a Hubble-like repair mission is beyond NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities. Many in the scientific community have wondered whether the Webb telescope is worth the risk and treasure. A decade ago, the journal Nature famously dubbed it \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Telescope That Ate Astronomy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Others consider the project, like some notorious American banks and lenders, simply too big to fail. Congress has tried and failed on several occasions to kill the Webb telescope. Like other politically engineered technical projects with subcontractors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 spread across the country, the celestial platform does not lack corporate support. NASA program managers press on. Key tests reveal flaws. The contractor identifies and presumably fixes the problems. Then on to the next technical hurdle. So it has gone for over a decade. If, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big if, the gamble pays off, a telescope named for a former NASA administrator instrumental in the political engineering of the Apollo moon landings will peer back in space and time to the formation of galaxies. The sunk costs of designing, building and testing such a sophisticated instrument leave little choice. The Webb telescope will be launched, sooner we hope than later. Parked at its desired point in the solar system, we can only hope the engineers, integrators and testers did their jobs without fail. If so, the James Webb Telescope will provide an entirely new perspective on the origins or our solar system and our place in the universe.      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
