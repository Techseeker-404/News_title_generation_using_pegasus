It will likely give the company an advantage in the short term and spur standards-based alternatives in the longer run. The company said its high-bandwidth HyperBus 8-bit serial memory interface will be included in the new eXpanded SPI (xSPI) electrical interface standard from the Jedec Solid State Technology Association. The xSPI standard defines requirements for the compatibility of high-performance x8 serial interfaces, including read and write commands, electrical characteristics, signaling protocols for command and data transfers, and a standard pin-out in a Ball Grid Array (BGA) footprint. It hasn\u2019t actually been finalized yet, and a Jedec representative wasn\u2019t available to comment for this article. In a telephone interview with EE Times, Rainer Hoehler, vice president of Cypress\u2019 flash business unit, said the inclusion of the HyperBus interface in the Jedec xSPI standard will simplify the design of HyperBus-based memories, as well as provide more flexibility for designers to implement instant-on functionality in automotive, industrial and IoT applications. The HyperBus Interface allows for faster boot time, direct execute-in-place (XIP) from flash, while reducing the amount of RAM needed. The 12-pin HyperBus interface consists of an 8-pin address/data bus, a differential clock (2 signals), one chip select and a read data strobe for the controller and is aimed at enabling a wide range of high-performance applications, such as automotive instrument clusters, infotainment and navigation systems and factory automation systems.  The 12-pin HyperBus interface consists of an 8-pin address/data bus, a differential clock (2 signals), one chip select and a read data strobe for the controller. The HyperBus technology can be traced back to Spansion, which merged with Cypress in 2015. The HyperBus interface  was introduced in 2014, and is complemented by Cypress\u2019 high-density HyperFlash NOR Flash devices for embedded systems, announced in the same year, and high-speed HyperRAM devices for systems that need expanded scratchpad memory,  first introduced in 2015. Hoehler said the standardization of the HyperBus opens up the ecosystem and also pulls together divergent xSPI technologies, letting designers choose which memory devices they want to use in their systems. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt makes life easier for chipset vendors and their customers,\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Hoehler\u00c2\u00a0 said. He said Cypress has plenty of design wins in the automotive sector, which is fine with committing to a pure HyperBus approach, but the industrial market is more fragmented. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey really rely on the standards they can choose,\u201d he said. Outside of those two segments, Cypress sees opportunity for HyperFlash in networking equipment to support 5G technology. Cypress has been focusing away from a low-margin, commoditized businesses and recently reported \u00e2\u0080\u009cstellar\u201d third-quarter earnings driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), the automotive market and USB-C. The company said its \u00e2\u0080\u009cCypress 3.0\u2033 strategy begun in 2016 to focus on the IoT is paying off faster than expected. Even as it looks to jettison low-margin engagements, industrial and automotive continue to key market segments. Jim Handy, principal analyst with Objective Analysis, said the foundation for its success in the latter goes as far back as Fujitsu, which spawned Spansion, now part of Cypress, and started the HyperRAM-HyperFlash-HyperBus troika. Getting this technology standardized under the auspices of Jedec will allow Cypress to make further inroads into any market it\u2019s already in, he said. The standardization comes as no surprise, Handy added, and it\u2019s advantageous for Cypress because it\u2019s been in production for several years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have leg up on all competition,\u201d he said. But although it\u2019s getting its day in the sun now, he said, and it will be able to sell to those people concerned about being locked into a proprietary technology, in the longer term standardization means other companies will offer the technology.\u00c2\u00a0 Winbond might be a contender, if only partly, said Handy, as it\u2019s become a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpowerhouse\u201d in SPI flash. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some SRAM companies start offering\u00c2\u00a0HyperFlash, too, but only if Cypress is successful in creating a market worth going after. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems like SRAM companies are a shadow of their former selves,\u201d he said.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0094Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.
