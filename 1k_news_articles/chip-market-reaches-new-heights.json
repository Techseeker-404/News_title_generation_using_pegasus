The three-month average of chip sales in August grew to a record $40.16 billion, up 1.7% from July and up 14.9% compared to August 2017, according to the SIA, which reports numbers compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization.   The chip market has consistently posted strong growth for the past two years, including turning in all time sales records for the past several consecutive months. However, annual growth has slowed in recent months after posting growth of more than 20% for 15 straight months. In July, the three-month-average of sales was up by 17.9% compared with July 2017.
