Infineon, which also enjoyed growth in industrial and power products, ranked 10th worldwide among semiconductor vendors, edging out Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek, according to market research firm IC Insights Inc.\u00c2\u00a0 Infineon last week reported sales of 1.77 billion euro (about $1.93 billion) for the quarter ended March 31, representing growth of 7 percent compared to the previous quarter and an increase of 10 percent year on year.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBusiness at present is running extremely well, in the first quarter the market for Infineon developed very encouragingly and the trend continued from January to March,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Infineon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, Reinhard Ploss. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe order situation is excellent and exceeds our early expectations. Against this backdrop, at the end of March we raised our forecast for earnings and revenue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  As in previous quarters, Infineon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive segment was the strongest, growing 11 percent over last quarter to 783 million euro (about $855 million) in revenue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe increase was due to good demand for products in driver assistance systems and for hybrid and electric vehicles. In Europe and China in particular, many microcontrollers, power semiconductors and sensors were sold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ploss said, highlighting that an automotive boom in China has seen the market for semiconductors grow by 20 percent while Infineon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share there has increased by almost 50 percent, allowing the company to expand on its position as number 2 in the market in that region. Strategy Analytics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 latest figures estimate that Infineon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of the automotive semiconductor market worldwide has grown from 10.4 percent in 2015 to 10.7 percent in 2016, cementing the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position as No. 2 in the market behind NXP Semiconductors. Infineon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasing market share in automotive power semiconductors, sensors and microcontrollers all contributed. Overall, sequential revenue growth of 1 to 5 percent is expected for the next financial quarter, while year on year revenue growth between 8 and 11 percent is forecast. Fiscal 2016-17 is expected to achieve the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest profitability for six years, with growth in the automotive segment expected to be faster than the group average. During a conference call about the results, Ploss also noted that customers were enthusiastic about the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET samples. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCustomers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 positive feedback shows us that we are pursuing the correct strategy with our compound semiconductors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ploss said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect that compound semiconductors based on SiC will be broadly successful in the market for solar inverters, while we have seen great interest for a whole series of industrial applications: charging stations for electric vehicles, uninterruptible power supplies, air conditioning units and automation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked about the failed acquisition of Wolfspeed (the deal was blocked in February by the Committee for Foreign Investment in the Unites States), Ploss replied that Infineon had continued developing its in-house SiC products in the mean time. While the company is confident of an \u00e2\u0080\u009coutstanding\u00e2\u0080\u009d position in the automotive sector for its SiC products, without access to Wolfspeed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full compound semiconductor portfolio, a broader approach to product development for the next generations of SiC will be necessary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this field, we will continue to grow organically and push developments in-house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ploss said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that there are any other suitable potential [acquisition targets] at present. But that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look around.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Wolfspeed would have been the best fit, he said, the company is continuing to look for other options, with a priority on the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just have to heed the [regulatory] environment when tackling any further potential acquisitions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
