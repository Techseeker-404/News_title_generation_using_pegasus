He had departed once before, flying to the moon aboard Apollo 11 in July 1969, station-keeping in lunar orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin made their perilous journey to and from Tranquility Base. The entire endeavor was about \u00e2\u0080\u009cleaving,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Collins concluded upon his return. Once back on Earth, he contemplated the fate of the planet, the entire circle he was able to view from his space ship on the outbound leg. En route to the moon on Apollo 11, too busy to doff his pressure suit.

That phrase was the tentative title of Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first book, eventually published to rave reviews as Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Journey. In recent years, Collins returned to that theme. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce upon a time I was flying in space somewhere and I looked down and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, Houston, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the world in my window.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 If you take that idea and expand it, you can have the world in\u00c2\u00a0your window. You can consider the world in your window, what you think about that world, how you think it might be changed, what part you might play in changing that world in directions you think are important for your values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mike Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 daughters announced his death after a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvaliant battle\u00e2\u0080\u009d with cancer. Pre-pandemic, they often accompanied their father to Apollo anniversary events and speaking engagements. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease join us in fondly and joyfully remembering his sharp wit, his quiet sense of purpose, and his wise perspective, gained from looking back at Earth from the vantage of space and gazing across calm waters from the deck of his fishing boat\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the Florida Gulf Coast. Honoring his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish, a Mike Collins memory: Your correspondent rode on a NASA bus with the astronaut and his daughters to a dinner at the Kennedy Space Center as part of a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 1 fire.

(Source: NASA) As we talked, a NASA functionary at the front of the bus inquired whether anyone aboard had any dietary restrictions. It turned out one of the Collins daughters did, but she was reluctant to speak up on the crowded bus. The father knew this, diffusing the situation by declaring, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I hate parsnips!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Retired U.S. Air Force Major General Michael Collins died on April 28, 2021, at a hospice facility in Naples, Fla., just up the road from his home on Marco Island. There, he had fished, painted, grieved over the 2014 death of his wife Pat, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cone and only true love of my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From his dock, Mike Collins found another window to contemplate the moon he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d visited and the stars that guided him there a half-century ago. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 George Leopold, the former executive editor of EE Times and the author of Calculated Risk: The Supersonic Life and Times of Gus Grissom, also writes the EE Times Critical Path and By the Numbers blogs.
