According to data from the International Monetary Fund, the cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 from the current pandemic crisis could be $9 trillion, greater than the economies of Japan and Germany combined. Once the public health crisis has been neutralized, citizens around the world are going to be looking to their respective governments to jumpstart their respective economies. Back in the 1930s, it took an initiative by President Roosevelt called The New Deal to bring the U.S. out of the Great Depression \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which implemented the 20th century infrastructure such as dams and a comprehensive highway and road system. It will likely take a new \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew Deal\u00e2\u0080\u009d-sized investment to reignite the global economy while also providing an opportunity for something positive to come out of the pandemic. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a growing chorus for governments to do more about climate change, but leaders have struggled to find the money, political will and momentum to turn this into action. With the backdrop of restarting the economy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunistic time to take advantage of what would surely have mass public support to deploy a nationwide (perhaps even worldwide) effort to update infrastructure with 21st century technology and come out of the pandemic with a smarter, more sustainable world. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing movement in this direction. Europe has begun planning to inject billions of Euros into high tech and green investments to help recover from the pandemic, and the topic has become a focal point on the U.S. presidential campaign trail. The challenge is that the U.S. government has steadily fallen behind in their understanding of technology since the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was a casualty of budget cuts in 1995. As a recent example of how woefully out of step with tech trends and issues the government is, we only need to look back to 2018 when Capitol Hill held hearings focused on user privacy. Technologies such as 5G, AI, cloud, cybersecurity, supercomputing, renewable energy and smart city infrastructure are expected to be at the forefront of any new \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew Deal\u00e2\u0080\u009d effort. These are all complex technologies with a multi-faceted supply chain, which will require more than a basic technical acumen to develop and deploy. Congress and federal agencies don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have, nor should we expect them to have, the technical shrewdness to be successful. As a result, the technology knowledge gap left without the OTA will be a challenge when it comes to how to source and deploy the 21st century technology that will allow us to better address climate change. The chips that power all these technologies can be obtained from numerous semiconductor companies. Some might be familiar to government workers, but most will be foreign companies unknown to those responsible for selecting vendors, and it will be an arduous process to put a trusted supply chain in place. The money to be had in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew deal\u00e2\u0080\u009d will make it an attractive target for bad actors looking to take advantage of that lack of knowledge, familiarity and experience within the government. These bad actors would likely seek to cash-in by supplying counterfeit chips at the expense of taxpayers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 money and with potentially catastrophic results. These fake chips are fraught with potential pitfalls from not working properly, not lasting as long as required or even including concealed, malicious functionality. For a chip used in critical public-safety applications, an unexpected failure could have catastrophic results. At this point you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be blamed for thinking there are simply too many challenges and risks to bringing 21st century technology to infrastructure to make it a realistic plan. The good news is there are solutions for the short term that can be borrowed from the military\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provenance tracking method, while there is the opportunity to use relatively new technology for a longer-term solution. In the short term, there are lessons the supply chain infrastructure can learn from a security initiative introduced by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in June 2018 called \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeliver Un\u00c2\u00adcom\u00c2\u00adpro\u00c2\u00admised.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The program aims to improve the DoD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to deliver mission-critical weapons, equipment and communications systems, free from either unintended or malicious defect. Essentially, it is a detailed tracking method to know where each component comes from, who had access to it to ensure it is not tampered with. In the long term, this could be the opportunity to utilize blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity of chips. Due to the cost of implementing a new process, the use of blockchain in supply chains has been a nice-to-have feature rather than a must-have, so it has not yet achieved widespread use in provenance tracking. However, with the amount of federal funds that would be used to fund these projects, it will be paramount to ensure genuine semiconductor parts are used so that expectations are met and citizens are protected. Blockchain provides the capability, and the government very well might be the catalyst to make it a ubiquitous supply chain technology. COVID-19 has been the most devastating pandemic to hit humanity in the last century. It has destroyed lives, communities and economies. As governments around the world look to repair the damage, they have the opportunity to consider long-term investments that previously would have been considered too ambitious in scale. But now is the time to consider solutions that are commensurate with the damage we all seek to recover from. This challenge isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t our first \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the global economy has emerged from previous hardships stronger and will likely do so again. And if our governments have the courage to invest in long-term, next-generation solutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like smart, secure infrastructure that enables a path toward a more carbon-neutral, energy-efficient world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we can emerge from today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disastrous situation into not only a healthier world, but a more sustainable one as well.
