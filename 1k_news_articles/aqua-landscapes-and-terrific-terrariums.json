You know what it\u2019s like \u2014 you\u2019re blissfully meandering your way around the Internet when you see something that makes you gasp \u201cOoh! Shiny!\u201d In my case, it was an uber-cool Terrarium that someone had created. My first task, was to find a suitable container. I really wanted something like a large fishbowl \u2014 ideally about 24-inches in diameter \u2014 but these proved to be surprisingly difficult to find. In the end, I opted for this 18-inch diameter handblown glass bowl that I found on Amazon Prime for $62, which turns out to be a really good price compared to some of the alternatives. As you can see in this video, my glass bowl arrived at my office and it\u2019s very tasty indeed.   My next mission is to start looking for the other things I\u2019ll need, including small stones, potting charcoal, sand, and soil; low-light, low-maintenance, miniature plants; and anything else I think will add to the overall effect. Before I ran across the terrarium idea, I first encountered a series of videos on aqua landscaping. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about you, but I\u2019ve never heard of this before. I\u2019ve seen fish tanks, of course, and I really like them (looking at them, not owning one), but the plants have always seemed to play second fiddle to the fish themselves. By comparison, in the case of aqua landscaping, it\u2019s the underwater plants that take center stage, with the fish just adding the cream on the top of the cake (I never metaphor I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like). Take a look at this video.   How about this monster?   And this video shows the results from the 2014 AGA International Aquascaping Contest.   Aren\u2019t these gorgeous? Some of them are like miniature underwater forests. Arrggh. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help myself \u2014 now I\u2019m wondering what it would be like to get a deep tank and create a combination aqua landscape in the bottom half complemented by a terrarium landscape on the top. I\u2019m going to have to noodle so this. Perhaps it will be a good project when I retire in 20 or 30 years\u2019 time. What about you \u2014 are you tempted to try your hand at any of these little beauties?
