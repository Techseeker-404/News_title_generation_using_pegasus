Of course, it was not an act of charity but part of a strategy to extend Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence from the desktop to the mobile world. Despite multiple high-profile lawsuits and years of dogged battle in a fast-moving, rough-and-tumble market, Android succeeded \u00e2\u0080\u0094 beyond Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wildest dreams. The software is used in more than 70% of all smartphones today \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than a billion handsets a year, according to IHS Markit. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mature market today, growing in mid-single-digits yearly, says IHS. Its hungry for more innovation, and Google can help by setting Android free. The European Commission took the lead in throwing a spotlight on the current issues with its historic $5.1 billion fine. At this stage, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer appropriate for Google to have a controlling influence on the Android roadmap and what Google apps get bundled with it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time that Android joins Linux as a fully open-source operating system. Yes, it will be messy and there may be some fragmentation. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what capitalism is like. Today, Google basically controls the Android road map, inviting a handful of market-making companies into development projects. When Android is truly free it will be a set of projects under the Linux Foundation or a similar group where all members are equals. True, Google may lose some mobile advertising dollars and need to scale back its R&D on the software. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m confident that others will see opportunities to step in and take Android in new directions. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for a mobile community that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grown a bit complacent, waiting for Google to tell it what the Android roadmap is at its annual I/O event.   "}
