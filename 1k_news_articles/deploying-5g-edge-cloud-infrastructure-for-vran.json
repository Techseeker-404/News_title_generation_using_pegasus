The 5G era is only just getting started. One of the most anticipated changes in the 5G network is the deployment of edge cloud infrastructure capable of supporting network functions, media content, and applications via frameworks such as mobile edge computing (MEC). This new nexus in the mobile network architecture enables operators to offer higher performance services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly low latency services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that are impossible or impractical to deliver with 4G and cannot be effectively delivered from large, centralized data centers. The 5G edge cloud infrastructure The software infrastructure on which edge applications will be deployed is critical. Classic cloud infrastructure software is designed for large centralized data centers and can be challenging to adapt to the edge because of the different operating models, the larger number of locations, and the smaller hardware footprints at the edge. Force-fitting legacy cloud technology into these requirements results in a suboptimal solution. Broadly speaking, operators have three options for edge cloud software infrastructure: an OpenStack distribution, proprietary virtualization/cloud platforms, or \u00e2\u0080\u009ccloud native\u00e2\u0080\u009d platforms (e.g., bare metal with containers and Kubernetes orchestration). None of these legacy technology approaches were originally designed to meet the operational and technological requirements of a massively geo-distributed edge cloud system. They were designed for deployment and operation within a single site. Choosing the right infrastructure is a complicated decision with lots of moving parts. The assumption is that operators want to leverage and shift to cloud native, containerized applications; however, they recognize that there is an issue with the readiness of network functions and operating processes. For example, virtualized network functions (VNFs) can run in virtual machines (VMs), but not containers. This requires the evolution of the VNF to a cloud-native network function (CNF). As the industry has taken quite a few years to virtualize their previously appliance-based solutions to virtual machines, it will take more time to transition to next-generation cloud native architectures. vRAN deployment and edge cloud Historically the radio access network (RAN) used in telecommunications was delivered via purpose-built systems that included the hardware, operating system, and the RAN application as a single vendor sourced, integrated solution. As 5G is driving a need for a much more flexible and nimbler network, the industry is moving to disaggregate the RAN to virtual RAN (vRAN) which separates the three components mentioned. The industry term for this is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisaggregation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Recommended:  5G? Wait \u00e2\u0080\u0099til Next Year  This enables the service provider to select best of breed pieces uniquely suited for their needs. It also reduces their dependence on a single vendor. Taking it a step further, the \u00e2\u0080\u009coperating system\u00e2\u0080\u009d mentioned above becomes an end-to-end virtual cloud infrastructure, hosting multiple applications. With 5G and vRAN, this has evolved into a distributed edge cloud infrastructure that can support a combination of vRAN, core, media, and multi-access edge computing (MEC) application platform would create a new paradigm in the mobile network architecture and enable new modes of services delivery.\u00c2\u00a0 Supporting the technology requirements this creates and delivering these capabilities with a high level of automation and ease of operation are critical needs. To make cloud platforms economic at the edge, operators need workloads that will justify the investment in facilities, hardware, and software infrastructure. This is resulting in some parallel development of the applications that will drive monetization of the network at the same time with the new network that will be needed to support the new applications.\u00c2\u00a0 Some argue that vRAN should be the anchor tenet for this \u00e2\u0080\u009cfar edge\u00e2\u0080\u009d cloud because the RAN by its very nature is high volume and widely distributed; therefore, vRAN becomes the leading-edge application that justifies the build out of the edge infrastructure. Following this, the new application workloads (IIoT, CBRS, automated factories, AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, etc) can \u00e2\u0080\u009cride\u00e2\u0080\u009d the vRAN buildout that by its own business case creates the infrastructure foundation for the required edge compute deployment. Challenges for deploying edge cloud for vRAN Deploying edge cloud for vRAN is not straightforward at this time; it involves new technology with demanding performance requirements. Ultra-low latency, high availability, scalability and security are 5G \u00e2\u0080\u009ctable stakes\u00e2\u0080\u009d and just listing them as requirements doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do justice to the complexity. Here is an example of the difficulty of meeting just the low-latency requirements: Many CPUs cannot support the ultra-reliable low latency connectivity (URLLC) 5G use cases, and the ones that do support them tend to be expensive. The combination of these issues multiplied across thousands of edge sites can diminish the opex savings that service providers are looking for with virtualization, especially because some platforms require 4-6 servers for high availability (HA) edge solutions when 2 would be the logical, and economical, minimum. Even one server can be used when radio coverage overlap is employed for high availability. Some of this issue is addressed by running highly efficient software infrastructure, and some of it by hardware acceleration. Hardware acceleration offloads certain computing tasks onto specialized hardware components within the system, enabling greater efficiency than is possible in software running on a general-purpose CPU alone. So, for this example, server hardware with efficient software infrastructure that includes accelerator support reduces the need for expensive CPUs in order to run edge applications \u00e2\u0080\u0094 thus making them economically viable. This need for hardware acceleration has emerged in the use of FPGA technology, such as the Intel FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N3000, using Intel Arria 10 technology as a reprogrammable platform to enable FEC acceleration for vRAN applications, ensuring at-scale enablement for the application on Intel Architecture servers. Also, the emergence of GPU acceleration such as NVIDIA Aerial for GPU-accelerated 5G vRAN is another option for hardware accelerated, but software defined solutions for this environment. GPU can provide other interesting capabilities for edge application acceleration for applications such as AR/VR. According to the same Heavy Reading research, respondents were asked to select their top three challenges. (The question generated 356 responses by 140 survey takers for an average of 2.5 responses per person.) When asked about the top three challenges to deploying distributed edge cloud for virtual RAN, respondents indicated that \u00e2\u0080\u009csystems integration\u00e2\u0080\u009d (58 percent) was the lead challenge due to difficulties associated with setting up a vRAN using hardware and software from multiple vendors, and then testing and verifying performance.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cOperational complexity\u00e2\u0080\u009d of multi-vendor vRAN came in second (46 percent). \u00e2\u0080\u009cEdge cloud server performance\u00e2\u0080\u009d came in third (36 percent). This is somewhat typical for NFV style technologies, as by definition they bring multiple vendors together at the service provider. Integrating hardware, virtualization stacks, and applications does not come without its costs and complexities. It is therefore key for vendors addressing this problem to work together to create and maintain reference implementations that can ease this burden of adoption. Expectations for deployment running high Expectations for vRAN are running high. Drawing from the Heavy Reading survey, half of respondents expect to have vRAN in commercial service within the next 2 years, of which 29 percent expect it to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cat scale\u00e2\u0080\u009d and 21 percent a \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall scale\u00e2\u0080\u009d deployment. This could be seen as a bullish response given that the first vRAN deployments have only recently gone commercially live, with the largest deployment consisting of just a few hundred sites. However, in Japan, Rakuten Mobile will launch 4G service in April 2020 with more than 4,000 macro vRAN sites deployed on edge cloud facilities. It intends to launch 5G on the same edge infrastructure later in 2020. Therefore, within 2 years (i.e., by the end of 2021), it is plausible that other operators will be able to scale vRAN. On the other side of the scale, 71 percent of respondents do not expect to deploy \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommercially at scale\u00e2\u0080\u009d over the near term. Thus, it could also be argued that this result shows that operators are positive about vRAN but are not over-committed to unrealistic deployment schedules. Further, this may show that initial deployments may be with mature single-sourced appliance approaches, but that the at-scale, cost effective and flexible network will be built out using virtual approaches exclusively. Feature and performance parity will be challenging within a two-year time period. Virtual 5G baseband may be achieved, but with it will come compromises relative to vendor-integrated state-of-the-art. Asked if it is practical to virtualize a 5G baseband, a.k.a. DU, function for commercial deployment within 2 years, a majority of respondents (60 percent) said yes. Of these respondents, 31 percent said \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with feature and performance parity\u00e2\u0080\u009d and 29 percent said \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but with feature or performance impacts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Virtual RAN does not negate the value of vendor-integrated, state-of-the-art RAN. This still can occur within a virtual architecture versus physical appliance-based approach. Further, it is clear that the motivations for 5G, including the new contemporary use cases such as AR/VR and autonomous vehicles will drive the need for more flexible application support in the RAN platform. This understanding is critical, as the inevitability of supporting edge based applications is the singular driving factor to selection of a virtual infrastructure for edge frameworks such as 5G vRAN, and deployment of those at scale. It will be exciting to see the maturation of this new technology in the RAN market space in the coming years. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Paul Miller is chief technology officer at Wind River Systems.
