Earlier this month, the Defense Microelectronic Activity (DMEA) raised the ceiling on its existing contract with GlobalFoundries to continue producing \u00e2\u0080\u009cleading edge, current and legacy microelectronics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The $400 million increase ups the total value of the Defense Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s multi-year arrangement with GlobalFoundries to more than $1.1 billion. That moves follows a $10.27 billion contract modification to eight systems vendors announced in June. DMEA and its Trusted Access Program Office essentially serve as a broker to ensure a steady flow of chips ranging from advanced to end-of-the-line devices used in U.S. weapon systems. GlobalFoundries is a long-time supplier to the U.S. military, and what amounts to a new line of credit will maintain the IC supply chain. The chip maker operates trusted facilities in Burlington, Vt., and two in New York at East Fishkill and Malta. Fab 9 in Vermont and Fab 10 in East Fishkill were acquired from IBM in 2015. GlobalFoundries announced in May it would upgrade its Fab 8 facility in Malta to comply with U.S. export controls on sensitive technologies. It has also implemented a \u00e2\u0080\u009cGF Shield\u00e2\u0080\u009d program that includes internal controls designed to protect customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intellectual property.

DMEA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raised ceiling for chip procurements is \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong recognition of that fact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ezra Hall, director of GlobalFoundries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 aerospace and defense business line. Strictly speaking, the DoD spending increase represents a line of credit rather than a standard purchase order. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink of it as a credit card limit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hall said in an interview. The chip maker declined to comment on specific military applications covered under the ceiling increase. When asked about chip packaging, an area along with test and assembly being emphasized in recent U.S. initiatives designed to reinvigorate domestic chip manufacturing, Hall indicated its contract with DMEA includes some \u00e2\u0080\u009cpost-fab activities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d GlobalFoundries has joined the growing industry chorus for greater investment in chip manufacturing and securing the microelectronics supply chain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the U.S. can [remain] a leader if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a leader in R&D\u00e2\u0080\u009d aimed at semiconductor technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hall said. Meanwhile, the pure-play foundry continues to make the case there is plenty of demand among military and commercial customers for devices manufactured at intermediate process nodes. With the rise of 5G-enabled AI technologies deployed at the network edge, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to be making chips that are smarter, not smaller,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hall argued.
