Her story shines a light on the status of online design tools and provides a role model for women in tech. As an employee of National Instruments, Baker was using a reference design to build an accelerator board linked to a steering wheel and a Nintendo emulator. A datasheet called for design symbols and footprints that she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find in her software tool. In her frustration, she saw the need for an online source of electronic design content, and the idea for SnapEDA was born. At 25, Baker lacked the money as well as the programming and business skills to start an online software company. But she had plenty of drive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tried to learn to code, but couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find enough time with my full-time job at NI, so I quit and started learning how to program with online tutorials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d recalled Baker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an EE in analog electronics from the University of Toronto \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to code that well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The self-education worked. Her initial code base became the starting point for SnapEDA, which now serves more than 80,000 users in nearly 200 countries. She was the startup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first customer and investor, bootstrapping her efforts for four years with contract work writing technical columns for Reuters and Forbes and programming for other websites. In 2015, SnapEDA was admitted into the Y Combinator startup program. She moved to a house in Silicon Valley, where she lived and worked with her first few employees. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe funded her because she had all the founder skills we look for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalton Caldwell, a partner at the Silicon Valley incubator that helped launch AirBnB and DropBox, among others. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer technical background was impressive and, having worked as a journalist, she was an effective communicator and had good industry connections \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and she had a prototype built with real users.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Baker worked and lived in a Silicon Valley \u00e2\u0080\u009chacker house\u00e2\u0080\u009d with colleagues in the early days of the startup.

Baker is an example of the delicate balance of skills that CEOs need, said Rowen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to be confident enough to jump out of the airplane, but still ready to take help from any and everyone you meet on the way to Earth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unusual combination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
