Their common mission is to develop safety standards for AI-driven systems in autonomous vehicles and robotics. With so many efforts pursuing the same critical goal, big questions loom. How much overlap will there be among the emerging safety standards? How well are these efforts coordinated? Will they leave any safety gaps unfilled? The answers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet clear, but the rollout announcements offer some clues, and EE Times has reached out to people close to the efforts for insight. IEEE alone is kick-starting several freshly approved working groups aimed at AV safety: IEEE P2846, IEEE P2851 and IEEE P1228. IEEE P2846, initiated by Intel/Mobileye, seeks a \u00e2\u0080\u009cformal model for safety consideration in automated vehicle decision-making.\u00e2\u0080\u009d IEEE P2851\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job, meanwhile, is a much-needed interoperable \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata format for safety verifications of IP, SoC and mixed-signal ICs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the working group. Just for good measure, IEEE has reactivated an IEEE standard originally developed for nuclear power plants. \u00c2\u00a0IEEE P1228 now will address AV software safety throughout the vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life cycle. IEEE isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t alone. Underwriters Laboratories\u00e2\u0080\u0099 draft of UL 4600 is currently on the ballot. Billed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe First Comprehensive Safety Standard for Autonomous Products,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it is a little different from other industry standards. Instead of prescribing how to do safety by following certain steps, UL 4600 offers a guide to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuild the safety case\u00e2\u0080\u009d for an AV design. Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jack Weast, chair of IEEE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new P2864 working group, sees UL 4600 complementary to IEEE P2864, calling UL 4600 the \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-hanging fruit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The standard offers a checklist against which AV designers can argue the safety case for their design elements. Finally, there are existing safety standards. One is\u00c2\u00a0 ISO/PAS 21448 (SOTIF) covering the \u00e2\u0080\u009csafety of the intended functionality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The standard focuses on guaranteeing the safety of the intended functionality in the absence of a fault. It thus stands in contrast to traditional functional safety described in ISO 26262, which aims at mitigating risk due to system failure. (Source: IEEE) This sudden rush to set standards for safety and reliability in AI-based systems is a marked departure from the practices of the very recent past.\u00c2\u00a0 AV developers have long kept their methods close to the vest, disclosing scant data to the public (except for miles driven and disengagements \u2014 deactivation of the autonomous mode when a failure of the autonomous technology is detected) and treating safety in self-driving vehicles as a wedge for competitive advantage. Today, neither industry nor government can assess the safety of self-driving cars. Without tools or common yardsticks, tech suppliers are working in the dark. By extension, the media and the public are told to take AV developers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 word that self-driving cars are safe. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the 64 million-dollar question: Are these developers finally acknowledging that the safety of autonomous vehicles must be a collaborative affair? Riccardo Mariani, vice president of industry safety at Nvidia EE Times recently asked Riccardo Mariani, vice president of industry safety at Nvidia, to walk us through each of the newly proposed IEEE standards. Mariani is an IEEE senior member and is the 2020 first vice president of the IEEE Computer Society. Further, Mariani is in an ideal position to see advancements by a variety of working groups in IEEE.\u00c2\u00a0 He is the chair of the P2851 and the co-chair of IEEE Special Technical Community. He is also the proposed chair of Industry Connection Activity. We wanted Mariani to explain the changes in the AV industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude, and how \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or if \u00e2\u0080\u0094 these new standards are supposed to work together. First, Mariani reminded us that in addition to these emerging industry standards, a few private initiatives were launched in 2019. For example, Safety First for Automated Driving (SaFAD) is led by Aptiv, Audi, Baidu, BMW, Continental, Daimler, FCA US LLC, HERE, Infineon, Intel, and Volkswagen. The group published a white paper last summer on how to build, test, and operate a safe automated vehicle. Separately, SAE International, along with Ford, General Motors (GM), Toyota, and Uber, launched the Automated Vehicle Safety Consortium. The members are \u00e2\u0080\u009cworking on the development of a series of safety principles for SAE Level 4 and 5 automated driving systems focusing on testing before and during operation of AVs on public roads; data collection, protection and sharing; and interactions between AVs and other road users,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the consortium. Standardization gaps While some of these private consortia provide best practices, their work product tends toward higher-level guidance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe market needs more detailed instructions\u00e2\u0080\u009d to implement safety in autonomous systems, said Mariani. Those could be forthcoming in the emerging standards, which appear to be pursuing different aspects of safety for AI-based systems. But a formal process to investigate potential overlaps or gaps in the standards might have to wait until IEEE establishes a new working group called \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndustry Connection Activity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mariani is the proposed chair of Industry Connection Activity.  Recommended  Intel Gets IEEE to Ask \u00e2\u0080\u0098How Safe Is Safe Enough\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for AVs   The industry wants to ensure that all standards and a suite of practices \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill be created without overlap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mariani. To achieve that goal, he said, the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) is drafting an Industry Connection Activity on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cassessment of standardization gaps for safe automated driving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The IEEE Industry-SA Connection Activity is expected to become a formal working group soon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe in two months or so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mariani. Its mission is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cidentify, analyze and assess existing standards and ongoing standardization activities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The planned working group hopes to connect the dots for industry by looking into the work of all related IEEE societies, including Vehicular Technology Society (VTS), Computer Society (CS), Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS). It will also connect with the relevant standards organizations, including the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Underwriters Labs. The goal is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmapping different standards for autonomous vehicles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mariani. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is very important because such a mapping can help experts or corporations decide where to invest their time and resources.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
