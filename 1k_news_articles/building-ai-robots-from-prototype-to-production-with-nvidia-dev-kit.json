Previously held back by the massive amount of data required to train machines as well as the computing power needed to analyze this information, AI has moved from science fiction writing to research, with bold promises of autonomous factory floors and human\u00e2\u0080\u0093robot collaboration. Riding an exponential wave of growth, data is no longer an issue. The requirement for raw computing power has also been recently met with enablers, like the Xavier technology from NVIDIA, which can process trillions of deep-learning operations every second (TOPS) using a fraction of the power required to run a workstation.  NVIDIA kit takes robotics to reality At the GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Japan earlier this month, NVIDIA revealed a kit that enables development and deployment of AI robotics in applications like manufacturing, delivery, retail and smart cities. With the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit, industrial application developers can now begin transforming those bold promises into reality. NVIDIA built the Jetson AGX Xavier specifically to meet the intense computational requirements for AI-powered robots. The computer module delivers the processing capability of a powerful workstation\u00e2\u0080\u009432 TOPS\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet fits in the palm of your hand. In its operating modes at 10 W, 15 W and 30 W, the Jetson Xavier offers over 10 times the energy efficiency and more than 20 times the performance of its predecessor, the Jetson TX2. The module has a 512-core Volta GPU with Tensor Cores. The Tensor Cores are NVIDIA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology to accelerate large matrix operations that are at the heart of AI. They perform mixed-precision matrix multiply and accumulate calculations in a single operation. Hundreds of Tensor Cores operating in parallel mean massive increases in throughput and efficiency. The Jetson Xavier module also integrates an eight-core ARM v8.2 64-bit CPU with 8-MB L2 + 4-MB L3, 16-GB 256-bit LPDDR4x memory to deliver 137 GB/s, 32-GB eMMC 5.1 storage, two DL accelerator NVDLA engines, a seven-way VLIW vision processor and encoder/decoder for (2x) 4Kp60 or HEVC/(2x) 4Kp60 with 12-bit support. NVIDIA took feedback from engineers and increased the number of I/Os, specifically USB connectors, in the developer kit to meet all possible data input and output requirements of future robotic equipment development. The extensive interfacing options now include:  PCIe X16 I/O for x8 PCIe Gen4/x8 SLVS-EC RJ45 for Gigabit Ethernet USB-C ports for two USB 3.1, DP (optional), PD (optional) close-system debug and flashing support on one port (16x) CSI-2 lanes to connect a camera M.2 Key M connector for NVMe storage M.2 Key E for PCIe x1, USB 2.0 and UART (for Wi-Fi/LTE)/I2S/PCM 40-pin header for UART, SPI, CAN, I2C, I2S, DMIC and GPIOs HD Audio header for high-definition audio eSATAp + USB 3.0 Type A for SATA through PCIe x1 Bridge (PD + Data for 2.5-inch SATA) and USB 3.0 connections HDMI Type A/eDP/DP connectors supporting HDMI 2.0, eDP 1.2a, DP 1.4 usD/UFS card socket to connect SD/UFS cards  The developer kit comes with the Jetson Xavier module pre-attached to a carrier board and thermal solution all together in a 105 \u00c3\u0097 105-mm footprint. The NVIDIA JetPack SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s installer flashes the kit with the latest OS image and installs developer tools, libraries and APIs. NVIDIA also tightly couples the hardware with more tools for the simulation, training, verification and deployment of Jetson Xavier, such as those included in the Isaac SDK. The hardware and software feature set has already chalked up early design wins with leading Japanese companies, including FANUC, Komatsu, Musashi Seimitsu and Kawada Technologies. Yamaha Motor has also selected the Jetson AGX Xavier to be the brain in a broad portfolio of intelligent machines, including unmanned agriculture vehicles, last-mile vehicles and marine products.
