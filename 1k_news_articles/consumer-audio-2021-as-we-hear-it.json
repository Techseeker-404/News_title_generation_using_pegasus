In 2021, new advances will meet dramatic social changes brought on by today\u2019s shifting environments for work, school and gatherings, and advances in mobility. New applications will evolve and new market niches will be created, even as legacy audio solutions continue to be disrupted. While there are many trends worth mentioning as we enter 2021, several stand out as opportunities for immediate impact: Voice as the user interface It\u2019s important to keep in mind that voice \u201ccontrol\u201d is still in its early phases of adoption. While the market reaction to this technology\u2019s potential has been overwhelmingly positive, the products themselves are only just beginning to expand beyond smart speakers and mobile phones. What are the next frontiers for voice as the interface? Eventually, we\u2019ll see it almost everywhere, especially throughout the home, because consumers will demand it. This will be increasingly true as the assistants become more intelligent. As natural language processing (NLP) evolves into greater accuracy and nuance, new applications will quickly follow. Voice-activated appliances and home systems already have a foothold in the residential market. We see hospitality and commercial applications as the next logical steps. Increasingly, elevator controls and information displays will become touchless, driven by the unique short-term challenges arising from the pandemic. As users get more accustomed to voice user interfaces (VUI), these changes will become a permanent feature. A well-designed VUI also have the benefit of easing more users into new technologies and advanced devices without a significant learning curve, thereby, leading to further adoption and growth of VUI. To take full advantage of these opportunities as they mature, Knowles sees more and more processing technologies moving to the edge, away from the cloud. This will not only result in improved user interfaces with lower latency, but will also reduce costs, both in dollars and bandwidth. Users will demand reliable performance in these applications driving the need for high signal-to-noise (SNR) microphones, edge processors, and algorithms that provide accuracy in noisy environments. OEMs that can deploy dedicated voice processing at the edge will be able to scale these applications and expand their portfolios. Remote trends will continue, post-pandemic While remote work was already in place at the beginning of 2020, the effects of the pandemic have created the beginnings of a \u201cnew normal\u201d for the workplace interaction. According to a recent Gartner Research survey, more than 80% of company leaders say their organizations plan to permit employees to work remotely at least part of the time upon reopening from COVID-19 and a further 47% of respondents would allow employees to work remotely on a full-time basis. This seismic shift will put increasing pressure on product manufacturers to offer rock-solid audio solutions reliable connectivity that business can count on. Whereas many of us had become accustomed to the annoying artifacts of conventional connected audio solutions, these are no longer acceptable. The compromises that we used to accept from poor audio communications \u00e2\u0080\u0093 glitches, fading and noise, to name just a few \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will no longer be tenable in the new remote workplace (or classroom, for that matter). The demand for audio reliability and sonic quality from personal and group computing products will resonate throughout the audio industry, both hardware and software. High-performance microphone arrays and voice capture algorithms will be serious differentiators. True Wireless: new standard for personal audio  True Wireless Stereo (TWS) is a completely wireless solution enabling stereo audio with no wires between the earbuds or the source device (Image: Knowles) While the early applications for wireless audio over Bluetooth were limited in terms of fidelity and utility, we\u2019ve seen many improvements, particularly in audio quality and connectivity. The most important so far is True Wireless Stereo (TWS), which is a completely wireless solution enabling stereo audio with no wires between the earbuds or the source device. \u00c2\u00a0Knowles moved into early into this game, led by a few forward-thinking OEMs and based on our heritage of delivering premium audio. Small form-factor ear devices enabled by TWS opens substantial new possibilities for both productivity and entertainment. Audio delivery can now be behind-the-scenes, intelligent and contextual \u00e2\u0080\u0093 call it on-demand performance. Together with greater reliability, comfort, and a long battery life, these devices will help realize a much-sought consumer expectation, namely the ability to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwear and forget\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u201ctake out\u201d their earbuds electronically, rather than have to physically remove or switch them. Naturally, other audio advancements will be integrated into these next-generation products. Adaptive noise cancellation will be a tremendous new feature, adjusting personalized response for individual fit and the ambient sonic levels of the user\u2019s environment. Technologies like small form-factor balanced armature that had originated from specialty applications such as hearing aids and gaming devices will become mainstream in these new products. In turn, they will create new markets for audio, spanning all ages. To enable these new applications, next-gen products will incorporate new, more advanced microphones, with broader frequency response, higher signal-to-noise ratios and reduced power consumption. These microphones will be intelligently coupled with edge processing technologies to help optimize both voice capture and audio output performance. Demanding new media, such as high-res streaming audio and spatial-3D audio content, will gain ground in the premium sector of the business. No doubt there are many more innovations that will enter the market as a result of these technological advancements. We look forward to having a hand in providing these foundational technologies for the next audio revolution.
