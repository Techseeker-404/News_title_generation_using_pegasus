Meanwhile, the auto industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-running obsession with reliability and functional safety continues unabated. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cnorth star\u00e2\u0080\u009d for establishing the reliability of E/E automotive systems is ISO 26262, the international standard for functional safety of electrical and/or electronic systems in production automobiles. Automakers and their Tier 1 suppliers are pushing semiconductor providers to deliver ISO-26262-compliant ICs together with evidence that the tools used to create the chips have qualified for the standards as well. Enter the IC electronic design automation (EDA) industry, where a battle is underway to convince chipmakers that their proficiency in functional safety reigns supreme. Yet, surprisingly, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig three\u00e2\u0080\u009d EDA houses actually maintain quite distinct approaches to helping chipmakers prove ISO 26262 compliance. So how should chipmakers evaluate these functional safety programs? Fresh from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfront lines\u00e2\u0080\u009d of automotive EDA and chip design, here are the top two things to look for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and one to run away from \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when evaluating an EDA provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s functional safety program:  #1:Beware of EDA functional safety programs focused on the qualification of flows instead of individual tools.  Why? Simply put, EDA is fundamentally a point solution market, and functional safety programs based on ISO-26262-qualified flows can disguise weaknesses in the reliability of individual tools. The vast majority of chipmakers develop their own flows comprised of specific tools from different EDA vendors. So when EDA functional safety programs prioritize the qualification of flows consisting only of their tools versus qualifying each individual tool on its own merit, they are ignoring the reality of how chipmakers design their products with EDA software. Like a house of cards, removing even a single tool from a qualified flow can render a certified flow ISO 26262 non-compliant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unless a chipmaker adopts wholesale only one EDA firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tools (which almost never happens). Better to stick to EDA vendors offering a tools-centric approach to ISO 26262, which allows chip designers to select the best tools for their design with the confidence that each qualified tool can comply with safety standards on their own and without reliance on the larger flow.   #2 is related, and it involves the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cTool Confidence Level\u00e2\u0080\u009d (TCL).  Despite rampant chest-beating in EDA press releases around TCL ratings, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remember two key things: (1) The goal of a software tool qualification program is achieving qualification \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not TCL. TCL is merely a metric toward qualification. And (2) the ability for a tool to stand alone and be qualified as TCL2 or TCL3 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 entirely independent of any other flows or tools in those chains \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important. Oftentimes, a tool that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a TCL1 flow is actually not a TCL1 tool when extracted from a specific flow \u00e2\u0080\u0094 again collapsing the house of cards. An alternative approach, and one recommended here, is to look for tools capable of standing alone, outside of any flow, and still supporting ISO 26262 compliance.   When to run the other way: Be sure that the EDA vendor stands behind its documentation . When validating a software tool, some EDA houses take responsibility for their validation evidence and some do not. The critical question to ask is this: Who maintains responsibility for the evidence? Some vendors add disclaimer clauses that state that the customer is responsible for confirming all evidence. Others may state that the evidence provided is not the responsibility of the EDA house. Make sure that your EDA house maintains responsibility of the validation evidence and keeps all evidence for more than 20 years past the release date. If you accept responsibility, whether you know it or not, you are assuming the risk and, potentially, the cost in re-validating all use cases for your design tool flow. With each qualification of ISO 26262 compliance, the EDA vendor produces a software tool qualification report providing that vendor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporting evidence demonstrating that all necessary and required steps to secure ISO 26262 compliance have been met. This information is invaluable to chip designers because it provides step-by-step instructions on exactly how their tools can be used to establish safety-qualified end products. But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing: A careful reading of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfine print\u00e2\u0080\u009d for too many EDA tool qualification reports reveals that, in fact, the customer is responsible for ensuring that the evidence is accurate. The lesson here: Read the fine print on qualification reports. If the EDA vendor doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the confidence to stand behind its documentation and \u00e2\u0080\u009cshow the work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d consider running away from this hidden cost of validation.  Of course, achieving functional safety encompasses much more than simply using ISO-26262-qualified tools. But what matters most in considering an overall tool flow is understanding that each step must be qualified to be used for the job at hand \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which, for all of us, is to help build the functionally safe, increasingly autonomous vehicle of the future. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Joseph Dailey (BEEE, MBA, and FSCAM) is Global Functional Safety Manager for Mentor, a Siemens business.
