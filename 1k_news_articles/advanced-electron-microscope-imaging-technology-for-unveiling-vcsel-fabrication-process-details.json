{"Author": "Msscorps\u00a0", "Date": "07.29.2020", "Keywords": "", "Article": " Driven by the vigorous development of smart phones, automotive light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and fiber transmission systems, the market size of infrared devices has gradually expanded year by year. Among many infrared devices, the development of vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) has attracted much attention. VCSEL has several advantages, including low initial current, nearly round beam, small beam angle, and etc. So that it has been a perfect device in reconstructing 3D topography and because of its low power consumption, iPhone X first applies VCSEL in 2017 to its face recognition application. According to the future tendency of artificial intelligence predicted by worldwide major analysis institutions, VCSEL will soon become the main light source for 3D sensing modules. Wider applications in vehicle and face recognition can be expected. From the perspective of fabrication process, there are three aspects to determine VCSEL quality:  Multilayer distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and diffusion barrier layer Multiple quantum wells (MQWs) Oxidation and oxygen diffusion layers  The above-mentioned structures are composed of multiple layers and each layer is only a few nanometers in thickness. Because of low differentiation in imaging contrast due to similar chemical compositions, it is difficult to clearly observe multilayer structures and their boundaries by an electron microscope with traditional methods, not to mention the subsequent material analysis. In order to overcome this problem, MSS develops a new imaging technology mainly for III-IV semiconductors \u2013advanced electron microscope imaging technology. Originally indistinguishable multilayer structures imaged under traditional methods now can be seen and analyzed by this advanced imaging technology. Precise data interpretation can be made, accordingly. MSS introduces this advanced electron microscope imaging technology by analyzing a commercially available VCSEL that was purchased directly from the market. The targeted of interest was disassembled from a VCSEL module, manufactured by Vixar, OSRAM (Model PLPVCC2 940A_P). The relevant specifications are listed in Table I. The analysis flow starts from macro view to microcosmic view step by step to introduce the details of VCSEL to the public.  Table I: Features of Vixar, OSRAM VCSEL module, PLPVCC2 940A_P. Device appearance Figure 1a is the optical microscope (OM) image of the VCSEL module after decapsulation. This module consists of two main parts: 1. Photo diode and 2. VCSEL array chip. From a zoom-in OM image shown in Fig. 1b, in total, the array has 281 apertures and each aperture can provide 7 mW of power, so the entire array has 2 W output power. Such high power output can be mainly attributed to the high stability of the process control and the relevant details will be addressed in the following article. The 3D topography of an aperture can be constructed by a 3D laser confocal profile. Figure 1c is a close-up image of an aperture in the array. From the surface topography measurement (through the sky color line in Fig. 1c), the diameter and the metal height (Fig. 1d) of the aperture structure can be obtained and its relevant dimensions are summarized in Table II.

Table II: Detailed dimensions of the aperture presented in the article. As mentioned earlier, imaging multilayer structures in III-IV semiconductors by an electron microscope with traditional methods is problematic. Poor multilayer contrast differentiation and unclear boundaries are seen, which drastically causes analytical difficulties. MSS has developed an advanced electron microscope imaging technology to solve these problems. In the following article, we are going to use this technology to analyze cross-sectional structures of the VCSEL. High-contrast cross-sectional observation and boundary determination The cross-sectional structure of an aperture in the VCSEL can be analyzed clearly by utilizing a high-contrast scanning electron microscope (SEM). Figure 2 is a cross-sectional SEM image of one of the apertures in the VCSEL array, where main internal structures are also addressed. From zoom-in SEM images (not shown here), the VCSEL has a total of 21 pairs of P-doped (P-doped) multilayer DBR and 44 pairs of N-doped (N-doped) multilayer DBR. The dimensions and relevant materials of the multilayer DBR are listed in Table III. Local zoom-in SEM images are presented in Figs. 3a-e.  Figure 2: A cross-sectional SEM image of the VCSEL presented in the article.\u00c2\u00a0 With the help of the advanced electron microscope imaging coupled with the electron energy filter technology, material contrast within the multilayer structure can be effectively enhanced and most importantly, the spatial resolution of imaging stays the same. So, the boundaries in the multilayer can be clearly distinguished (green braces in Fig. 3d and oxide layer tip boundary in Fig. 3e); in contrast, using traditional SEM imaging methods (Normal imaging, Figs. 3d\u2019 and 3e\u2019), the images of the multilayer is blurred and boundary determination becomes an impossible task.  Table III: The dimensions and relevant materials of the multilayer DBR presented in the article.

Diffusion range determination  Figure 4: a A SEM image taken by advanced imaging technology. b Fullcolor display of a. c Zoom-in image of a. Oxygen lateral diffusion in the multilayer DBR is one of important fabrication processes in VCSEL. This process plays a key role in uniformity distribution of the output light and the divergence angle, which in turn affects the accuracy of 3D reconstruction. In general, elemental diffusion can be determined by utilizing a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS). Due to its limited spatial resolution (about 40 mm) and complicated sample preparation at the diffusion area, however, SIMS is not a suitable tool for this purpose. Therefore, MSS derives an advanced imaging technology to analyze the diffusion area at the edge of the multilayer DBR. The contrast differentiation between the diffusion area (high resistance area) and the non-diffusion areas can be perceived (Fig. 4a). The differentiation can be even further enhanced by using full-color display (Fig. 4b), where the boundary between diffusion and non-diffusion areas can be visually observed. The fact that uniform contrast found in the diffusion area indicates high stability of the diffusion process. In addition, if we carefully observe the contrast at the boundaries (the blue dotted line in Fig. 4c), it is not a steep change through the boundary, but a gradual procession with a different gradient at each layer (black arrow in Fig. 4c). This result provides useful and important information for process engineers to adjust their diffusion processes. Microstructure Microstructure of VCSEL is analyzed by a scanning transmission electronic microscope (STEM). Due to its high spatial resolution, excellent contrast in composition and defect comparison, STEM has become a perfect tool to analysis fine structures and their interfaces, especially for III-IV semiconductors. With the help of the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) equipped on the STEM, elemental distribution information of the structures of interest can be attained.  Figure 5: a A Cross-sectional SEM image of the VCSEL. b to e STEM images take at locations marked by red dotted rectangles in a. f A STEM image taken from a different sample at around oxide layer where one defect is found. g Delamination is found at around oxide layer taken by TEM ZC mode, taken from another different sample. High-resolution microstructure analysis Figures 5b to 5e are VCSEL STEM images taken at locations marked in Fig. 5a. Comparing to the previous SEM images (Figs. 2 and 3), more details can be observed in STEM images, especially near the oxide layer (Fig. 5e, gallium oxide). The local strain field caused by gallium oxide (marked by the green arrow) can be clearly observed. How to comprehend and governor the strain field within the gallium oxide, in order to ensure a better power performance is one of important topics for process engineers. Inhomogeneous local stress induced by poor process control of the gallium oxide layer will cause unexpected defects, low yield issue, and low lighting performance/output. Two examples taken from different samples are demonstrated in Figs. 5f and 5g.  Figure 6: EDS mapping analysis at around oxide layer Figure 6 reveals the result of EDS mapping near the oxide layer, where distribution of relevant elements can be observed. The fact that uniform oxygen signal shown in gallium oxide (Fig. 6b) strongly suggests the manufacturer\u2019s high stability in the oxidation process. Composition gradient observation In addition to the uniformity of the oxide layer and the stress control, the process uniformity of the multilayer DBR is also one of important issues that determine the quality of the VCSEL. During fabrication processes, atom inter-diffusion between neighboring layers is inevitable. There is no doubt that SIMS is the best tool to provide quantitative results about atom diffusion. For qualitative understanding, however, electron microscope is still a good choice and the results can be directly observed by naked eyes. As we mentioned before, the most challenging thing is how to clearly distinguish the boundaries of the multilayer DBR (Fig. 7b, green dotted line). MSS develops a unique image processing technology to solve this problem. With the help of this technology, more detailed multilayer structure (Fig. 7c) can be clearly seen. This allows engineers to have a qualitative understanding about the composition gradient in the multilayer DBR.  Figure 7: a A cross-sectional multilayer DRB STEM image. b A zoom-in STEM image from a, marked by a red-dotted rectangle. c Full-color display of b. From Figs. 5 to 7, based on microstructure results, high stability in the gallium oxide and multilayer DBR processes can be observed. These provide a strong evident why the current VCSEL can have such high output power. Conclusions In this report, we use two electron microscopes (SEM & STEM) to analyze the internal structure of the VCSEL. Through advanced imaging technology and image processing method, we can analyze fine structures of the oxide layer and the multilayer DBR, which cannot be obtained by traditional imaging methods. This valuable information will provide important clues for process engineers to design and produce higher quality and performance products in the future. MSSCORPS CO., LTD.
