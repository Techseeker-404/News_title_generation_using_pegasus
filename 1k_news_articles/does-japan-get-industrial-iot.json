They know how to install and use them effectively to improve productivity\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially on the factory floor. Unfortunately, all that knowhow doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily translate to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Germany still holds that title. Many Japanese companies are listening to what German companies like Infineon Technologies have to say about \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndustry 4.0.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Infineon Tuesday (Sept. 26) held a press briefing on IIoT security in Tokyo. Yasuaki Mori, president of Infineon Technologies Japan, stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Japan is behind in IIoT. Japanese companies are very knowledgeable of their own \u00e2\u0080\u0098use cases.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mori is afraid, however, that Japan might be missing the whole point of IIoT. He reported that many Japanese corporations\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 who prefer to stick to their own knitting\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seizing the opportunity to transform their business by connecting with others on IIoT. In short, Japanese might know the mechanics, but they actually don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get what IIoT is really for. \u00c2\u00a0  Steve Hanna, Infineon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior principal and security expert based in the United States, came to Tokyo as a main speaker at the IIoT briefing. Hanna described, extensively, what he sees as the real value IIoT. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me, the most exciting thing about IIoT is that it creates new business models,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\u00a0 Take the example of Kaeser Compressors, he said. Kaeser is a German company manufacturer of compressed air and vacuum products. Kaeser customers who used to buy from Kaeser machines to compress air no longer need to do so. Instead, they can get from Kaeser compressed air per cubic meter, doing away with the big initial investment in equipment. Instead, they get a small monthly bill. This transformation is similar to the choice between \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuying a car or taking a taxi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Hanna. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany manufacturers are looking at IoT\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 just to do that so that they can shift their business from selling things to selling services.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Equally valuable is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpredictive maintenance\u00e2\u0080\u009d enabled by IIoT, Hanna said. He cited VR Group, a state-owned railway company in Finland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you know, it is extremely cold in Finland,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too cold, sometimes the doors [of a train] wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t close.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This makes maintenance a critical business for the Finnish company. Previously, VR Group regularly changed door parts and components\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 regardless of their condition. But by installing sensors into the doors, the company has begun getting \u00e2\u0080\u009cearly warning signs for failure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hanna said. Sensors can detect when doors start to close a little slower, a sign of impending trouble. IIoT has given VR Group greater reliability at lower cost, he explained. In many cases, corporations are convinced to use IIoT because it can make their processes more efficient. But the unresolved reality is that even though IIoT is an excellent time-saver, most business\u00c2\u00a0are unprepared to handle a cyberattack on their IIoT systems. If Infineon is serious about talking the Japanese into IIoT, the promise of efficiency alone wouldn\u2019t do the job. The Germany company must demonstrate an expert knowledge of hack attacks, and strut its stuff in IIoT hardware security solutions. IIoT hacks are only growing Hanna admitted there have been a growing number of IIoT hacks in recent years. Examples include Stuxnet, a malicious computer worm that targets industrial computer systems. It caused substantial damage to Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear program. Another hack attack struck an unnamed steel mill in Germany. This was revealed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after the fact \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by the German Federal Office for Information Security just before Christmas 2015. Hackers reportedly disrupted control systems at the mill to such a degree that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in \u201cmassive\u00e2\u0080\u009d damage. Last December, after a power cut hit part of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, researchers investigating the incident determined it was a cyber-attack.
