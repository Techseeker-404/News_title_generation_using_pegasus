Most test engineers develop in-house software for controlling equipment and storing/analyzing data. That's a good way to keep instrument control and data storage \u201cclose to home,\u201d even though many companies store data on their networks. The problem may come from having to deal with company IT departments, whose people may not understand engineers' needs.    GradientOne is one of a handful of small companies that offers products to let engineers use cloud services for instrument control, data storage, and data analysis.    When originally released in 2016, GradientOne's software needed hardware assistance in the form of a gateway that connected test instruments to internet cloud services. Now the company has added an application programming interface (API) to its cloud-based software. The API, which runs in Google's cloud, includes instrument drivers for about 100 popular instruments such as oscilloscopes, meters, and power supplies. The company has also added drivers for motor controllers. That number of instruments doesn't compare with the likes of LabVIEW, but it does give engineers easy access to the cloud.    In addition to adding drivers, GradientOne has added the ability to apply analytics in the cloud through pre-packaged turnkey analysis features. Process and predictive data analysis such as data plots can indicate when products are drifting out of tolerance. Analytics let engineers compare data across product lines and can specify batches to analyze.  The hardware engineer has become a software engineer to solve a hardware problem, said GradientOne's Nick Edwards in a conversation with EE Times. \u201cTest data analysis and analytics software runs in the cloud instead of on a local PC. When you crunch numbers yourself, it becomes burdensome.\u201d        GradientOne software lets you upload measurement data directly from test instruments to the cloud for storage and analysis. Once data is uploaded, you can use the software to search metadata as part of your analysis. If you do need to analyze data with Excel, Matlab, or another software package, you can export test data in CSV format.    In addition to adding data analysis, GradientOne cloud software adds lab tracking that can evaluate usage of test instruments. Suppose you have more than one facility in different time zones. You can track usage of your equipment and, through the cloud, use equipment remotely. That lets you optimize asset usage. \u201cAsset tracking lets you compare labs for efficiency,\u201d said Edwards. That can lead to cost savings if you can avoid purchasing more hardware.    All instruments need calibration, and GradientOne can track calibration dates, letting you know when it's time to send instruments to the lab.     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
