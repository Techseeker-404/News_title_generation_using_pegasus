E-commerce shopping sites such as Amazon and Alibaba, which sell electronic devices and components, are considered distribution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s competitors. The announcement stirred up a lot of interest in the electronics industry. Separately, Texas Instruments is dropping Avnet as a distributor, effective December. TI is the latest in a string of semiconductor companies that have severed ties with Avnet. Avnet has opened a superstore on Alibaba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1688.com, a site focused on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s B2B procurement and wholesale market. In terms of revenue, Avnet is among the top three electronics component and solutions providers in the world and its moves are closely watched.

Amazon and Alibaba are the world\u2019s two largest e-commerce \u00c2\u00a0giants, with a total market value of more than $1.1 trillion. \u00c2\u00a0Both are available to companies that want to expand their foreign trade channels and promote their brands. \u00c2\u00a0Why did Avnet choose Alibaba, not Amazon? Experts told ESM China that Amazon\u2019s main battlefield is in North America and Europe, while 1688.com focuses on China\u2019s B2B procurement and wholesale market. Chinese manufacturers are far from purchasing components through Amazon, although they will buy from Alibaba. \u00c2\u00a0Avnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice of 1688.com seems obvious\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 to strengthen its presence in the Chinese market. However, according to ESM China sources, local end-users prefer domestic vertical component e-commerce platforms over 1688.com. Some industry insiders admit that end customers will choose 1688.com\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0 followed by Taobao\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 for relatively low-tech connectors, terminals, connecting lines and small modules. The end-user population on Alibaba is not high, but sources point out that Alibaba is still valuable in the domestic component distribution market for spot dealers and traders which cannot find components through their own channels. They may find them on Alibaba. These traders typically buy and sell within a closed group and provide account services that allow small enterprises to enjoy privileges similar to large OEMs. These relationships tend to be very strong. Alibaba also has an advantage over professional electronic component and e-commerce platforms concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta region. Many mainland electronics companies, purchasers, engineers and research institutes are not familiar with these e-commerce platforms, but they will still buy through Taobao, Alibaba and other outlets. Other sources suggest the Avnet-Alibaba alliance is a branding exercise. Revenue-generation through the Alibaba site will be proof of Avnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success. The importance of the Chinese market The importance of the Chinese market to the development of the global electronics industry can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be understated. In recent years, both semiconductor manufacturers \u00c2\u00a0and distributors have shifted their focus to China. From a\u00c2\u00a0 strategic perspective,\u00c2\u00a0 Avnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to China has been slower than that of some of its peers. Avnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand marketing strategy in China is also slightly lacking, and its revenue ranking has gradually declined. Avnet has also suffered from a realignment among semiconductor suppliers. Just this week, Texas Instruments\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the few semiconductor companies that has retained a broad product portfolio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 announced it was disengaging with Avnet as of Dec. 30. Since 2017, Analog Devices, Cypress, Broadcom, Silicon Labs and other semiconductor manufacturers have discontinued relationships with Avnet. Avnet has also laid off employees in China and Avnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress in the market has been slower than expected.  Recommended   Texas Instruments Disengages with Global Distributor Avnet   This year, however, Avnet has\u00c2\u00a0 made some strategic adjustments. It has strengthened its position in the Internet of things (IoT) by building an end-to-end IoT ecosystem. The IoT market has experienced explosive growth in the past few years, and China is one of the fastest growing countries in the IoT universe. Avnet is committed to transforming the IoT market and has made several important changes to capitalize on IoT. The company sold its Technology Solutions division and has acquired small-volume distributor Premier Farnell; the maker community Hackster.io; and the intelligent hardware consulting firm Dragon Innovation. There are indications that the Avnet-1688.com alliance aims to strengthen the distributor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expansion in the Chinese IoT market. Alibaba is China\u2019s largest wholesale platform for industrial products which can be extended to industrial IoT applications in the customer base. Secondly, Alibaba has the advantage of a cloud service platform. Through cooperation with Alibaba Cloud, Chinese developers can accelerate IoT prototyping on a familiar, universal platform with built-in cloud connectivity and bring their \u00c2\u00a0IoT solutions to market faster than ever. Finally,\u00c2\u00a0 by opening a super store on 1688.com, Avnet can improve its global e-commerce strategy and \u00c2\u00a0expand its online presence in China to serve customers in the SMB market. Market headwinds All distributors are facing a tough market in 2019. Global trade tensions and tariff policy restrictions have become the biggest challenges for global distributors. Coupled with weakening \u00c2\u00a0end-user demand, distributors are facing more pressure on profitability than expected. Cost-cutting and spending control are the most direct and effective means of increasing revenue and profitability. In addition, distributors are exploring emerging application areas and innovative operating models. In this case, Avnet is cooperating with Alibaba to open an online super store. This is one way of coping with the harsh competitive environment. Overall, the channel has had a lackluster year. Avnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00c2\u00a0fiscal Q4 sales declined year-over-year. Avnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost-reduction efforts indicate the current economic situation is not favorable.\u00c2\u00a0Online sales \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which reduce overhead expenses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can be improved through Alibaba.\u00c2\u00a0Avnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model \u00c2\u00a0is\u00c2\u00a0 global high-volume distribution, serving global OEMs and well-known brand manufacturers. However, the importance of small-volume online transactions is increasing. Although Avnet completed the acquisition of small-volume distributor Premier Farnell in 2016, the company said it wants to provide e-commerce customers with more flexibility. \u00c2\u00a0Its partnership with 1688.com seems to fit the bill. \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0Fendy Wang is managing chief analyst of ESM-China, an Aspencore group publication.
