{"Author": "Junko Yoshida\u00a0", "Date": "01.19.2017", "Keywords": "", "Article": " Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just me. The idea of having \u00e2\u0080\u009cmachines\u00e2\u0080\u009d constantly listening to me in the privacy of my living room, bedroom, kitchen or \u00e2\u0080\u0094 God forbid \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the bathroom? It freaks me out.  When Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO Jen-Hsun Huang introduced in his keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show something called \u00e2\u0080\u009cNvidia Spot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a small artificial intelligence microphone designed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cextend intelligent control throughout the house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he put it, I did a double-take. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid he just say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nvidia Spy?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d At CES, we also learned that Alexa isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just for the Amazon Echo anymore. With the help of Alexa Voice Services, any developer can now add the Amazon virtual assistant to their device; Google\u2019s letting developers do the same with Google Assistant. In short, even if I don\u2019t want a microphone eavesdropping on me, I may no longer have a choice.  This is the new norm the industry was trumpeting at the Consumer Electronics Show. Hardware suppliers, software designers and service providers are enamored with the power of AI. The next big thing is AI data centers fully equipped to collect, learn and analyze data, transforming all that eavesdropped data into \u00e2\u0080\u009cinformation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Who am I to judge? As I reported from the show floor, we face a future in which convenience trumps privacy and the suspension of disbelief breeds insecurity. It struck me that practically everyone is willing to go along without much questioning the consequences. Who am I to judge? The new generation of kids, as I learned recently, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t memorize the multiplication tables in school. Why bother when you can just Google: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Google, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5 times 7?\u00e2\u0080\u009d If I were a 7-year-old today, I might consider Google Home my best friend. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking for actual data on how consumers perceive the emerging market of voice-enabled digital assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home. What I found is a survey result from Accenture, in a report called Dynamic Digital Consumers. Between October and November 2016, Accenture did a questionnaire survey with approximately 26,000 consumers in 26 countries. The survey found that only 4 percent of respondents own a voice-enabled digital assistant. While that seems like a very small portion of the population, two-thirds (65 percent) of owners said they use the device regularly. Accenture interpreted this as \u00e2\u0080\u009cshowing strong acceptance of this new technology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Actually, voice assistants on smartphones are also becoming popular, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas the AI technology powering these services has improved dramatically,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Accenture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYounger consumers are leading the adoption, with more than four in five (84 percent) of 14-to-17 year olds saying they either use this technology today or are interested in doing so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The survey also found that consumers are willing to embrace a wide array of potential AI-powered, personalized services, with a majority interested in personal health assistants (cited by 60 percent), smart trip assistants (59 percent) and entertainment advisors (51 percent). The findings confirm a wide-open market for vendors to add a layer of voice-enabled AI features to every new device. However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m puzzled. Why ask machines questions when we have family members, friends, teachers and colleagues to answer them? Next page: Breaking down the survey results     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
