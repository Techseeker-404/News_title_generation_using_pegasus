The Economist points out that this would be an outlandish idea in normal times, but then says it deserves consideration. Patent licensing and trading is a normal part of a technology business, but this offer is much more than that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Huawei is offering the ability to replicate its entire cellular offering. Trying to replicate Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product line sounds like a bad business idea, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s break it down. 23 reasons: the telecom infrastructure ecosystem  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not cynical to say the mobile telecom ecosystem is past the high growth stage (2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2010), as shown in Figure 1. Shown below is global population, cellular subscribers and YoY growth, where worldwide mobile subscriptions exhibit a classic S-curve. This chart includes the cellular evolution from 1G to 5G, but the implications for infrastructure and handset markets are telling. Both markets evolve from new market expansion to slower replacement sales. Equipment vendor opportunities come with the introduction of new technology, such as 5G, to operators and consumers. Without these sales, the ecosystem relies on replacement, densification, and population growth. Figure 1. Mobile subscribers: global population, cellular subscribers and year-on-year growth (Image: SAR Insight & Consulting) Table 1 lists 23 of the major telecom infrastructure vendors from the global cellular rollout. The competitive forces that drive market rationalization are still present, with Huawei, Ericsson, and Nokia dominating the market for infrastructure, and newcomers facing long odds against the incumbents. Outside of the dominant vendors, most have left the business, been acquired, or participate in local and small cell markets. Table 1.

The primary markets for this proposal are those that have banned Huawei, namely the USA and some allied nations. In every market, the new company could expect fierce competition from others. Patents. Huawei will include their patents in the stack, but the new entity will soon hear from IPR lawyers representing the other infrastructure vendors, including Qualcomm. Licensing Huawei patents do not shield the new entity, and it will need to make additional arrangements. Field service. Telcos are notoriously conservative and look to long term supply continuity, including the field service team. Software. Billions of lines of code here to parse through and support if the vendor wants to surmount the security allegations. Understanding and maintaining someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software is a Herculean task for any firm to take on. Legacy. 5G needs LTE to work in NSA mode for the immediate future. It will be many years before telecoms shut down the legacy 4G technologies. Recent 4G LTE base stations are software upgradeable, reducing the market opportunity and raising barriers for a new entity. Scale. Where does this new venture compete, and how does it gain sufficient economy of scale? The banishment markets are not enough, not even for Nokia and Ericsson. Supply chain. Be sure that Huawei (and China Inc.) are working furiously to rid themselves of American choke points \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it is an existential issue. What happens to the new entity when it needs to source the Chinese components and then sell into the banishment markets? Been there, done that Sourcing someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kit can work, but is fraught with risk, so why is this offer different?\u00c2\u00a0 Motorola was a leading infrastructure vendor in 2G but stumbled with 3G and eventually sourced Huawei kit for its 3G offering, which was interpreted by the market as a going-out-of-business strategy. Motorola could have borrowed the Zenith slogan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe [Huawei] quality goes in before the [Motorola] name goes on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Net on Huawei 5G licensing While not an impossible task, building a new entity and executing a successful business plan is daunting in the telecom market, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to see a full-scale competitor built by Huawei technology any time soon. \u00a0 Joe Hoffman is Director of Wireless Connectivity and Machine Sensing at SAR Insight & Consulting.
