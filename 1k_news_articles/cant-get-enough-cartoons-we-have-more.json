Indeed, cartoons about life as an engineer have been around for many years. Don't believe me? Well then, you must see four cartoons from 1986 and 1987 in EE Times' then-archrival/now-sister-publication, EDN. They're a little dated now, but surely you can write some new captions.   From time to time, EDN would insert a cartoon into its \u201cSignals & Noise\u201d section, which is where readers would write to the editors. (Often readers would point out deficiencies in circuits from the Design Ideas section.) The cartoons were used as filler, and this didn't appear in every issue.   Click on the cartoon  below to jump to the first of the four 1980s cartoons posted on Tuesday, Dec. 26. Once there, you'll find links to the other three, posted on consecutive days through today.        This cartoon originally appeared in EDN on September 14, 2011.   \u00e2\u0080\u0094Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
