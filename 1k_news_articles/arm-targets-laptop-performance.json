Analysts praised the architecture\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leap forward but said that they doubt Arm will take a significant share of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s x86-based notebooks. The Cortex-A76 arrives in tandem with new Mali G76 GPU and V76 video cores. All three are expected to appear in premium smartphone SoCs before the end of the year. The A76 marks a full redesign for mobile systems, packing up to 2-Mbytes L2 cache, 4-Mbytes L3, and running at more than 3 GHz in a 7-nm node. It aims to deliver 90% of the Specint2006 performance of an Intel mobile Skylake chip with one-fourth the area and half the power \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or roughly the same performance in thermally constrained systems. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to close the gap with Intel \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this marks the first step in a new family, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the biggest leap we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken in our roadmap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mike Filippo, an Arm fellow and lead architect for the A76. Compared to an A72 core at 10 nm, a 7-nm A76 should deliver 35% more performance or use 40% less power. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a step up from 15% to 25% increases that Arm typically delivers with annual core upgrades. In its day, the A72 delivered about 75% of the performance of Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mobile Broadwell processors. The comparisons are based on CPUs running at similar frequencies. Arm acknowledged that Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chips typically support higher frequencies than Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cores. Although TSMC announced a 4-GHz A72 test chip, few SoC makers are expected to push their designs to such extreme speeds. Arm is preparing a separate core for wired servers and networking gear. The A76 aims to expand Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dominance in smartphones into laptops with 4+4 A76/A55 configurations sporting large caches. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see meaningful volumes in laptops,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Filippo, but some analysts disagree. Arm-based notebooks lack differentiation, said Bob O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell of Technalysis Research. They offer slightly less performance and about the same price as x86 systems. Although the Arm portables sport longer battery life and often build in cellular modems, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell doubts that those factors will sway many buyers. That said, Asus, Hewlett Packard, and Lenovo announced Arm-based notebooks running Windows 10 on Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Snapdragon SoC. To date, Qualcomm has been the leading proponent of such designs.    With its Cortex-A76, Arm removed performance bottlenecks and optimized features across its mobile core architecture.
