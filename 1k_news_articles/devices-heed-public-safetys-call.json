For first responders, the transition from LMR to LTE cellular is on the horizon. Because public safety requires more robust PTT cellular devices than standard smart phones, expect a major bump in FirstNet-geared hardware.\u00c2\u00a0 However, in both private and public sectors, a bigger window is opening for IoT/LTE application development due to the growing desire to aggregate tasks into one device. Agencies will soon receive more tactical information from all active incidents, including verbal transmissions, without ever touching a communications device. It will be like Siri or Alexa on steroids.\u00c2\u00a0 And as app sophistication advances, the voice function could become a much lower-priority than data that supports a plethora of new capabilities. Meanwhile public transportation, hospitality, field services, and users from many verticals are already starting to deploy PoC applications. In hotel management, the maintenance department once managed via radio communications is now adopting smart devices such as as iPod Touches with PoC apps, tied to property management computer networks. Better wireless accessories are possible as future technologies emerge such as Near Field Communications which can automatically connects headsets/PTT buttons to phones or tablets. Augmented reality will allow sales reps to share links to 360\u00c2\u00b0 experiences of their demos instead of traveling to trade shows or customers. Artificial intelligence is acting as a 24/7 watchdog to identify potential system issues before they become problems. FirstNet has created a nationwide market opportunity that could prompt major corporations such as Honeywell, General Dynamics, Boeing, and others to enter the public safety communications space with new sector-specific devices. For FirstNet to be successful, it must include reliable, secure, low- latency device-to-device and group calling, talker ID as well as location and data services, interconnection with legacy systems, console interfaces and specialized apps. There be bumps in the broadband road along the way. But without a powerful yet affordable wireless network, there will be no advanced communications.\u00c2\u00a0 Hang on tight, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a heck of a ride! \u2013Dave George is chief engineer and president of Pryme Radio and an RF engineer with 29 patents.
