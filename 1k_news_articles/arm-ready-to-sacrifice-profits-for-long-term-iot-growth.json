He also believes that over the next couple of years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to deliver more processing power than the brain but that processing power alone will not be enough, especially with the need to process, analyze, and do something with the data obtained. On the Vision Fund, he said that SoftBank has made 36 investments during the year since it was launched, but with only two in Europe, and that in the next two to three years, it expects to have 80 to 90 companies under its umbrella. He dismissed suggestions that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fund was fueling a bubble in the tech industry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you take a 10-year view, short-term valuation fluctuations are not relevant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He added that some of the tech companies with hundreds of billions of dollars in cash will start becoming prolific investors competing with their own Vision Fund. Misra also said that China is creating a huge tech ecosystem now, which may end up being bigger than Silicon Valley in terms of its impact. The critical factor was not capital but the mentors and the role models, which come from more and more successful tech companies in countries like China.

With many AI conferences today, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of generalist discussion as there was at CogX on the impact of AI, AI taking over jobs, ethics of AI, and women in AI. But this time, there was also an attempt to make generalists aware of what the chip and hardware players are doing to enable this. Companies like Intel, Graphcore, and Lighton explained in simplistic terms to the audience the basics of the hardware options for AI \u00e2\u0080\u0094 CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, intelligence processing units (IPUs), and optical processing units (OPUs). FiveAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, Stan Boland, also outlined the essential elements of developing hardware technology for fully autonomous vehicles. In particular, the panel hardware players emphasized the need for a different approach to addressing the requirements of deep learning for AI and why an optimal balance of computation and communications architecture for each algorithm has to be reached to get the best performance from the hardware. Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Casimir Wierzynski, from the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s artificial intelligence products group in San Diego, highlighted its accelerator for deep learning and its work on silicon photonics circuits to bring lasers right onto the wafer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day, we could bring light directly into the deep-learning accelerators,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Simon Knowles, co-founder and CTO of Graphcore in Bristol, U.K., said that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new wave of chip companies that are designing processors from scratch specifically for machine intelligence. Igor Carron, co-founder and CEO of LightOn in Paris, France, added that optical processing was the future for large-scale AI using optical computing, which can make use of diffusive media as memory. James Wang, an analyst at New-York-based Ark Invest, said that AI hardware had already come a long way and that the key to scaling up AI performance another 100,000 times would be to develop new substrates such as optical, analog, and quantum and to develop more efficient algorithms. In addition, he emphasized that TPU designs were fine but would be insufficient to supplant Nvidia, stating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNvidia is the most ferociously competitive company in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nitin Dahad is a European correspondent for EE Times.
