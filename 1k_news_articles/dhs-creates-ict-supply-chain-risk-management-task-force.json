This public/private partnership is tasked with creating recommendations to identify and manage risk in the global ICT supply chain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ICT Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force embodies the type of cross-sector, whole-of-government engagement that is critical to protecting our global digital economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robert Mayer, senior vice president for Cybersecurity at U.S. Telecom and co-chair of the task force.

This development comes in the wake of recent suspicions around security issues in the electronic supply chain. Late last summer, for example, President Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act. In part, it banned the U.S. government and government contractors from using products from Chinese suppliers including Huawei and ZTE technology. Both government and business entities are being attacked by a variety of cyber threats from foreign adversaries, hackers, and criminals. These bad actors pose a threat to electricity providers and other critical infrastructure such as wastewater facilities or manufacturing plants. All tiers of the supply chain, including contractors, sub-contractors, and suppliers, are being targeted by increasingly sophisticated threats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThreats to the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IT and communications supply chain can severely impact our national security and nearly every facet of our economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said National Protection and Programs Directorate Undersecretary Christopher Krebs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe nature of supply chain threats, because they can encompass a product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire life cycle and often involve hardware, make them particularly challenging to defend against. Government and industry have a shared interest and thus a shared responsibility in identifying and mitigating these threats in partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 The Task Force will seek holistic solutions across a broad set of stakeholders to develop near-and long-term strategies to address supply chain risks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The task force is part of the DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (NPPD) Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Program. The C-SCRM Program leads, at a national level, the effort to address risks to ICT product and service supply chains by developing and deploying supply chain risk management capabilities for Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, private sector critical infrastructure owners and operators, and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The task force will be jointly chaired by DHS and the chairs of the Information Technology (IT) and Communications Sector Coordinating Councils and will include members from various companies in the IT and communications sectors. John Miller, vice president of policy and law, at Information Technology Industry Council will co-chair with U.S. Telecom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mayer.\u00c2\u00a0 The corporate roster includes a breadth of organizations including: Accenture, AT&T, CenturyLink, Charter, Cisco, Comcast, CTIA, CyberRx, Cybersecurity Coalition, Cyxtera, FireEye, Intel, Information Technology Industry Council, Information Technology Information Sharing and Analysis Center, Microsoft, National Association of Broadcasters, NCTA, NTCA, Palo Alto Networks, Samsung, Sprint, Threat Sketch, TIA, T-Mobile, US Telecom, and Verizon. On the government side, the task force will include members from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of Treasury, the General Services Administration, the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Social Security Administration. The group will create best-practice playbooks that will be useful to both government agencies and businesses. The task force will determine priorities, identify a scope of work, develop a plan of action, and establish milestones. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExecutive Committee members agreed that the task force would begin by conducting an ecosystem analysis of existing industry and government supply chain initiatives to identify consensus best practices and concentrate efforts on critical gaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the announcement said. Guidelines are a good start, but ongoing implementation is critical to success. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe work of the Information Communications Technology Supply Chain Task Force in developing playbooks for both government agencies and U.S. organizations to hammer out operational responses to security risks in the supply chain is critical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matan Or-El, co-founder and CEO of Panorays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs cybercriminals use sophisticated approaches to infiltrate the supply chain from product inception to end-of-lifecycle, all links in the chain must be secured in very different ways. Even after a playbook has been designed and implemented, online companies will have to continue to monitor the cybersecurity of all digital assets on a continuous basis, including all third-party vendors. This undertaking requires automation to review and alert on any possible holes in the security fabric so they can be quickly addressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
