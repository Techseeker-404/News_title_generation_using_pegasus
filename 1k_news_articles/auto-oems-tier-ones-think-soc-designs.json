Game-changing technology undertakings and hyper business growth in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous cars are turning automotive design platforms upside-down. Moreover, technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094from computer vision to 3D mapping, LIDAR to deep learning\u00e2\u0080\u0094are continuously converging and colliding on the way to making self-driving vehicles a reality. The stakes are high for this transformation from a social standpoint because lives can literally be affected. Fatal crashes involving Tesla and Uber vehicles are a reminder that engineering self-driving cars requires extraordinary care at the system level. Automotive manufacturers are undergoing technology disruptions and consequently can no longer conduct business as usual with Tier-1 suppliers. OEMs, Tier-1s, and new entrants, such as Uber, should carefully review and assess design components to ensure vehicle safety and reliability. (Source: Arteris IP)   From Code Bloat to Custom Hardware  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about time that car OEMs and Tier-1s start looking at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under the hood. All carmakers should get involved in choosing their technology-enabling semiconductors. Recently, ADAS and automated driving applications have transformed from highly complex software-based products running on generic CPUs and GPUs to specialized system-on-chip (SoC) solutions employing advanced technologies, such as deep learning and neural networks via hardware accelerators. ADAS developers have shifted from \u00e2\u0080\u009ccode bloat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d using thousands and even millions of lines of software code, to SoCs designed to enable autonomous driving tasks in hardware. This shift promises to dramatically reduce the number of lines of software code required in these systems, which in turn helps limit functional safety risks. Mobileye, an ADAS pioneer, has made its mark with by moving toward SoC designs that ensure safety within the practical power limits of most cars by implementing heterogenous systems where software needs drive the hardware architecture.

Take, for example, the interconnect that touches all parts of the SoC design and has become a key enabler of system-level features , such as functional safety and quality-of-service. The on-chip interconnect handles the majority of IP blocks and communication services while feeding all the hardware accelerators at the right time. This increases processing bandwidth, lowers system latency and power usage, and complements functional safety features in ADAS and autonomous driving applications. The SoC interconnect plays a vital role in facilitating functional safety because it interacts with all the data on chip. Consequently, on-chip communications are a critical building block in meeting the overall functional safety requirements. Selecting interconnect IP that is developed in accordance with the ISO 26262 functional safety specification can save OEMs and Tier-1s several man-months spent qualifying an automotive chip that must meet functional safety specifications. The Interconnect Renaissance  In the past, the interconnect was the last piece of the puzzle put in place before a design was sent off to the fab for manufacturing. However, automotive chips are becoming bigger and more powerful and are running algorithm-specific hardware accelerators. Moreover, automotive SoCs are using specialized IPs to manage multiple sensors and cameras. Traditional methods of connecting all the processing elements on a chip are becoming inadequate. Another crucial design premise that on-chip interconnects complement in large, complex automotive SoCs is memory innovation. Automotive SoC architects are increasingly avoiding slow, power-hungry DRAM accesses. Instead, they implement cache coherence, which enables processing elements to share data more quickly without the overhead of direct software management. That, in turn, helps SoC architects optimize the overall data flow and ensure quality of service to meet bandwidth and latency requirements for non-deterministic automotive designs. Here, the on-chip interconnect works side by side with memory architecture, regardless of whether it is cache coherent or non-coherent. An ISO 26262-compliant interconnect IP relieves chipmakers, Tier-1s, and car OEMs of a significant amount of work related to functional safety requirements. (Source: Arteris IP)   The details of the interconnect of an automotive SoC design show how on-chip communication is intrinsically intertwined with system-wide improvements in performance, safety, cost, and power efficiency. Now, imagine the value chain in which an IP supplier licenses interconnect technology to a chipmaker, which provides the automotive SoC to a Tier-1 supplier. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why both automotive OEMs and Tier-1s should look under the hood to ensure the SoCs they are getting from chipmakers can deliver on their functional safety requirements for ADAS and autonomous driving. This will save companies precious time spent reworking. More importantly, it will help carmakers ensure they bring safe, reliable vehicles onto the road. SoCs mark new territory for automakers that have otherwise mastered manufacturing, systems engineering, and mechanical engineering competencies. \u2014 Kurt Shuler is vice president of marketing at Arteris IP and has extensive IP, semiconductor, and software marketing experience in the mobile, consumer and enterprise segments working for Intel and Texas Instruments.
