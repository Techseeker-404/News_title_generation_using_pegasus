Though an IC design industry CEO, he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mired in the minute details of which IC sensor and processing architecture configuration would become dominant, or which EDA and/or semiconductor companies would come out on top as suppliers. Rather, he was more interested in questions such as: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill vehicles in the future be mostly owned by individuals, or owned and leased by companies, or maybe the government?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And if one of the latter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat new autonomous transportation business models will arise and which companies will become dominant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amid this pondering, he made the observation that in the digital age, the most successful companies are those that offer the \u00e2\u0080\u009coverall system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in other words the best vertically integrated system that combines the best hardware, software, network, ease of use, business model and indeed marketing machines (think Apple with the iPhone, iTunes, apps store, etc.). The whole is exponentially more powerful and valuable than the sum of its parts. The concept of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best overall system wins\u00e2\u0080\u009d is especially interesting to ponder in the context of the autonomous vehicle industry, where the competition is fierce and the stakes are high and deadly serious. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an emerging market where the primary goal is to get people and goods from point A to B safely (dramatically reducing traffic accidents and deaths), as quickly as possible and with the least impact to the environment\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and of course offer a cool looking product. The race to be the company with the best overall system for autonomous driving is complicated by the fact that it will require government buy-in. And unlike other industries, liability is, and will continue to be, one of the biggest concerns at every step in the evolution of autonomous driving. Bad press and lawsuits will surely slow progress down and rightfully so for checks and balances reasons, but the autonomous industry will surely continue to progress. In the early stages of autonomous driving, in the V2V era, the overall system will seemingly be the individual autonomous automobile. The most successful systems companies will likely be those who develop vehicles that can react appropriately in real time to the unpredictable and erratic driving behavior of humans in other vehicles, as well as to changing road conditions\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and look cool. One would expect the field will thin out, as some fail to make this cut. Some folks suggest that the next step in the evolution of V2V era, will see companies competing not only on the strength of their autonomous vehicles but on which companies can offer the most elegant networks facilitating new on-demand or lease options. This will mean that we consumers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to own a car, we can sort of share it with the world. What will the overall system champions look like as we move to the V2I phase? V2I is where visionaries believe things will seemingly get very surreal and sci-fi. Some people envision that in the age of V2I, vehicles will no longer have steering wheels and will be at the mercy of the vehicle we are riding in. Some folks envision soon after, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll then see an evolution to \u00e2\u0080\u009cI2V,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which the infrastructure will control autonomous vehicles that seamlessly transport folks and goods from point A to point B. The infrastructure will do so extremely efficiently in convoys with each vehicle drafting mere inches away from the vehicle in front and behind it. They suggest we will all carry devices that the infrastructure can continuously monitor, and when we walk across a busy street (which no longer has a stop sign!), the network will stream cars around us. We and autonomous vehicles will all be packets in a network \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we will be part of the overall system. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, some people predict that this V2I/I2V future and the challenge will become 3D in complexity: autonomous vehicles will not only drive but fly us and our goods from place to place \u00e2\u0080\u0094 drones flying as the crow flies.     The winners in these markets will seemingly be the companies offering not only the best vehicles, best ownership or leasing options but also the best and most reliable networks run in conjunction with government smart city and smart infrastructure systems. The amount of sophisticated electronic sockets and software to accomplish this is mind boggling. Admittedly all of this seems a long way down the road (or up in the air), and there are many steps to get to V2I/I2V let alone 3D V2I/I2V. One step that will certainly need to be taken at every phase in this evolution is for companies to develop and employ methods to deal with chip, software and network failures across their entire systems, much in the same way that aeronautic companies and space agencies coordinate the building of safeguards into not only their spacecraft, but into all the systems that launch and support the crafts, too. Even with safety standards like ISO 26262 demanding that OEMs and suppliers record the steps they take in developing the hardware and software in their systems, eventually we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see greater use of high-reliability schemas such as redundant circuits, triple module redundancy, and error correction at the heart of circuits in autonomous systems. Today, ISO 26262 documentation is often viewed as merely a \u00e2\u0080\u009cCYA\u00e2\u0080\u009d process to shield companies from liability and point fingers more accurately when things go wrong, but the true reliability will be found in advanced verification techniques (that are still not fully realized) as well as borrowing tried and true methods from aeronautics and high-reliability systems, and innovating new tools and methodologies. Indeed, the penultimate goal is for the automotive supply chain to develop chips, software and systems that are not only extremely reliable but can identify and self-correct problems in the inevitable event that problems will someday occur. This will become imperative in a scenario where an autonomous vehicle is driving in Bay Area commute. This will become imperative in a scenario where an autonomous vehicle is one of many in a convoy, inches from the bumper of the cars in front and behind it. It will become imperative when the car is a packet in a network weaving between pedestrians. And it will become beyond imperative if we are doing any of the above, but at altitude. Gravity is a bummer.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 A step in the right direction is a new design for test (DFT) technology from Mentor, a Siemens business\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tessent Group called Tessent MissionMode. Rather than the traditional use of employing DFT to reduce expensive tester time at manufacturing, this DFT technology is \u00e2\u0080\u009cinline\u00e2\u0080\u009d and lives in the chip throughout the life of the chip, and can be programmed to constantly monitor the health of the blocks in a chip. In a clever SoC or system configuration, companies can use it to develop self-correcting systems, as well as systems that provide instant feedback to drivers, dealerships/operators/OEMs and even to manufacturers. This provides knowledge to avoid disasters, truly lessen liability risk through proactive maintenance, as well as help IC suppliers and manufacturers develop better next-generation chips. And to boot, Tessent MissionMode already has ISO 26262 certification documentation. You can read about Tessent MissionMode in a white paper \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cTessent MissionMode: New Inline DFT Tech for Self-Correcting Automotive Architectures\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that I co-wrote with DFT guru Steve Pateras. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mike Santarini is a former EDA and semiconductor editor with EE Times, EDN and is now the director of IC EDA content, Technology Marketing, at Mentor, a Siemens Business.
