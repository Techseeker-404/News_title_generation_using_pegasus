But of all the safety measures deemed necessary for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), the DMS is the hardest sell. That is certainly true for consumers, and it appears to be the case for the media too. As one EE Times reader recently commented: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople know when they are too tired to drive. They don\u2019t need a robot telling them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Right or wrong, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a common sentiment among drivers. In Europe, however, DMS is a mandate in progress. The DMS assessment by the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) will begin in 2024. The organization is currently developing test protocols in collaboration with DMS suppliers. DMS is expected to be incorporated in mass-market vehicles. Click the image above to enlarge. (Source: Euro NCAP) Will this be a tipping point for naysayers to finally embrace DMS? Perhaps. But most likely, NCAP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s baseline DMS will fall short of the effective DMS applications pitched by some leading technology suppliers. The reality is that \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarmakers are shifting to \u00e2\u0080\u0098good enough, NCAP compliant, cost effective\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thinking,\u201d observed Ophir Herbst, CEO of Jungo. SPONSORED | Transient Voltage Suppressor on Signal Integrity of Microelectronics System with CMOS ICs under System-Level ESD Test With nobody paying OEMs to add DMS, this is inevitable. DMS in phases Indeed, the first baseline DMS might prove to be a dud. Some industry observers, speaking on condition of anonymity, suspect that the first draft of NCAP testing protocols might be even limited to head pose, with no eye tracking. If true, that would be a definitely low bar compared to what leading DMS developers claim to have already developed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ranging from the ability to monitor eyelid opening, gaze direction, facial expression and drowsiness. But Euro NCAP technical director Richard Schram expects \u00e2\u0080\u009ca base version [of DMS] on every vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u009d first. A technology roadmap will follow in \u00e2\u0080\u009cphases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The assessment of driver monitoring system is now delayed by two years from the roadmap above originally published in 2017. (Source: Euro NCAP) (Click on the image for an enlarged view.) Cost battle The mandate for DMS in every vehicle thus becomes a cost battle. To win, DMS suppliers must do a few things. Foremost, they need to demonstrate their technologies fit in subsystems already installed in vehicles. Jungo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Herbst, for example, observed that many cameras are coming into vehicles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for DMS, occupant monitoring systems (OMS), and gestures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 each easily adding $70-$100 in cost. The holy grail for OEMs, in his opinion, is \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving eventually a single camera that can do everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including DMS.  The video above shows how Jungo is enabling DMS, child detection, and even gestures in a single system. (Source: Jungo) Herbst also noted the convergence of SOCs inside vehicles, resulting in the deployment of a fewer, more powerful SoCs. This trend is prompting OEMs to license DMS/OMS software directly from DMS software suppliers such as Jungo, instead of through a Tier 1. This is because \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe software stack affects many subsystems (ADAS, autonomous, infotainment, HUD) and there are evolving feature sets growing in time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. Herbst stressed that Jungo \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartners with almost all\u00e2\u0080\u009d chip suppliers, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cQualcomm, Texas Instruments, Xilinx, Ambarella, Nvidia, Renesas, Intel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe plan to remain agnostic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHardware agnostic\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a common mantra among DMS vendors, including Seeing Machines, Smart Eye and Cipia (formerly Eyesight). That said, there are subtle differences in their approaches. Hardware vs. software Consider Seeing Machines. As previously reported, Seeing Machines generates roughly half its DMS business from solutions available in software, the rest via chips. Seeing Machines tabs Xilinx as its long-time silicon partner for DMS. It also offers OEMs a second option of software-only DMS, creating \u00e2\u0080\u009can optimization path\u00e2\u0080\u009d for specific chips OEMs prefer. A good example is Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon automotive platform is making inroads in in-vehicle infotainment and ADAS. With Seeing Machines, Qualcomm is devising \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very optimized software pipeline that makes use of not only the standard Arm cores on that device, but the proprietary Qualcomm accelerators,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nick DiFore, Seeing Machines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 senior vice president for automotive, told EE Times. Cognizant that DMS isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only application ADAS processors will run, DiFore called optimization \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery important.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DiFore also acknowledged that Seeing Machines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 DMS software runs on Nvidia, Renesas, TI and others \u00e2\u0080\u009con a wide array of platforms that are popular among OEMs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smart Eye is solidly committed to software only DMS solutions. Smart Eye CEO Martin Krantz said his company made a strategic choice for hardware agnosticism ten years ago. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe market has since proven us right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Krantz said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe situation was different when Mobileye in the early 2000s chose to develop their own silicon for their ADAS algorithms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The supply of high-capacity auto-grade SoCs was very limited, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow there is a very large number of different processors that will all work for DMS and interior sensing, and there are all sorts of reasons for an OEM or a Tier-1 to select one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Krantz said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been very efficient in supporting the most common platforms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he cited as a key to Smart Eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market strength. Smart Eye will continue working with top chip and sensor suppliers, explained Krantz, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso that we are in synch with the rapid hardware technology development.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Recommended  Can We Get ADAS and DMS Work Together? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Time for Automakers to Get Serious About Safety\u00e2\u0080\u009d Name the Mobileye of Driver Monitoring Systems  What about IP? Among all DMS suppliers, Seeing Machines appears to be in a league of its own. In September, pushing its DMS deeper into the market, Seeing Machines announced a new-generation AI engine called Occula. With this, it officially stepped into an IP play. Available in both software and Xilinx\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Fovio Chip form, the Occula neural processing unit enables next-generation Driver and Interior Occupant monitoring systems, according to the company.\u00c2\u00a0Seeing Machines is making Occula available for license in ASIC form to chip suppliers. It wants Occula to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfit efficiently into semiconductor companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own automotive compute platform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jungo CEO Herbst, on the other hand, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe absolutely do NOT develop our own chip or IP.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Given the megatrends he sees, with DMS moving from limited-edition L3 vehicles into mass-market L2, adding independent DMS hardware \u00e2\u0080\u009ccreates several complexities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It poses quandaries for OEMs to consider\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009ccamera placement (each vehicle has different interior design), available compute options, sensor types (IR/RGB/RGBIR).\u00e2\u0080\u009d In short, Herbst concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOEMs want this [DMS] software to run on existing compute options along with other applications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said Jungo is leveraging accelerators from vendors, such as the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE) from Qualcomm, CVFlow from Ambarella, programmable logic from Xilinx, and DSPs from Texas Instruments. Playing up to DMS + ADAS future Cipia (formerly known as Eyesight) maintains that its software offering is also \u00e2\u0080\u009chardware agnostic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tal Krzypow, vice president of products, said it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan work on anything from basic Arm processors, to powerful neural processing unit (NPU) based SoCs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cipia hopes to differentiate through its relationship with Mobileye. Krzypow said his company is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first party to integrate\u00e2\u0080\u009d its DMS software on Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EyeQ4 ADAS SoC. Mobileye \u00e2\u0080\u009cchose us as their DMS supplier because they realized that they want to offer this end to end offer and to the market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Krzypow. The operative idea is that exterior signals detected by ADAS shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be isolated from interior signals picked up by DMS. The fusion of two systems is viewed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe next evolution of road safety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Semicast Research lead analyst Colin Barnden noted. This conforms to the long-term view of Euro NCAP, whose goal is DMS that not only effectively detects impaired and distracted driving, but also provides \u00e2\u0080\u009cappropriate warning and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 effective action, such as initiating a safe evasive maneuver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As summarized in Euro NCAP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2025 roadmap \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Pursuit of Vision Zero,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment will \u00e2\u0080\u009cevolve around how reliably and accurately the status of the driver is detected and what action the vehicle takes based on the information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Translation: they envision DMS to mind-meld with ADAS. Barden anticipates [DMS] integrated with ADAS to \u00e2\u0080\u009cform part of Euro NCAP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future roadmap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d predicting a start \u201cpossibly around 2028.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cipia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Krzypow highlighted the inherit advantage of joining its DMS software on the SoC with Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary ADAS algorithms. This \u00e2\u0080\u009cmakes it easier for us to communicate with ADAS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One can run Cipia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DMS software on another chip (non-ADAS chip) and connect them via CAN bus, for example. But he stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you the reduced latency and the efficiency of having the two work together\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the single ADAS chip. A slide from Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2019 CES deck shows that Eyesight (now Cipia) has its software running on Mobileye Open-EyeQ. Unclear, though, is how much tuning and customization Mobileye and Cipia have already done in their respective software, as they try to coordinate Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary ADAS algorithms with Cipia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DMS signals. EE Times confirmed with Intel on Mobileye-Eyesight announcement made two years ago. But we were unable to talk to Mobileye by press time. (Source: Mobileye, January, 2019) According to Krzypow, Cipia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DMS software running on Mobileye EyeQ4 is \u00e2\u0080\u009calready with several potential customers for evaluation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Actual commercial DMS closely tied to ADAS, however, is not here yet. Cipia might not be alone in seeking a DMS+ADAS combo. Given Seeing Machines DMS software \u00e2\u0080\u009coptimization\u00e2\u0080\u009d efforts with Qualcomm, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to imagine Seeing Machines and Qualcomm/Veoneer well on the way to customize and tune their ADAS and DMS signals. Proving effectiveness of DMS Clearly, the initial goal to see DMS in every garage is driving OEMs toward the path of least resistance: cutting costs. But if the mission is to ensure long-term viability for DMS, there are some tough questions:  Mandate or no mandate, can DMS prove its worth? If so, when? How sure is anyone that consumers (who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what \u00e2\u0080\u009cDMS\u00e2\u0080\u009d means) can be convinced to spend extra bucks for vehicles with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore effective\u00e2\u0080\u009d DMS?  There are two parts to prove DMS effectiveness. The first is what the automotive community calls \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh availability\u00e2\u0080\u009d of signals. In layman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terms, a vehicle (whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s autonomous or ADAS vehicle equipped with a driver monitoring system) needs a perception or vision system that works close to 100 percent of the time. At 95 percent an AV system can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be called safe; it can\u2019t really be safe at 99 percent. The industry must devise a sensor fusion strategy to augment vision systems that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work well in rain, fog or snow. The same applies to DMS. In a production car, DMS needs \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh availability\u00e2\u0080\u009d of signals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 close to 100% using just IR vision, explained Barnden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHence the importance of the \u00e2\u0080\u009coptical path,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is tremendous R&D effort (and a lot of patents) in the application of IR emitters, IR CMOS image sensors, lenses, lens coatings, IR filters to eke out a couple of percent and even fractions of a percent to increase availability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The biggest problem the industry discovered with the 850nm optical path used in Super Cruise was that it was blinded by the sun. Next stop: 940nm. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a massive problem, cautioned Barnden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe vision algorithms have to be optimized to work best with particular combinations of optical components. So if an OEM goes for the cheapest emitters, image sensor, LED driver ICs, lens and filter, they have to optimize and validate the algorithms to work with that combination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0The killer issue, he added, is that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to have it automotive qualified for that specific combination of components, which takes 2-3 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In short, DMS developers who thought they had nailed their own algorithms could end up spending years in re-jiggling their software to adjust it to optical solutions chosen by OEMs. Software might well run on any chip inside a vehicle, but it must be tuned to the OEM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferred optical path. The second part is the human machine interface (HMI). Cipia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Krzypow called this \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrickier\u00e2\u0080\u009d for DMS because HMI is developed and owned by OEMs. Today, when DMS senses drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 drowsiness, a common HMI trick is to light the instrument cluster and display a coffee cup icon. Mercedes-Benz \u201cATTENTION ASSIST\u201d feature detects driver drowsiness. (Source: Mercedes-Benz) Krzypow asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes it help anyone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Who, if drowsy, would notice? Overly active driver-alert systems, on the other hand, are a well-known problem, often leading a driver to turn off the entire DMS system. Some OEMs, such as GM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SuperCruise, have developed a multi-stage alert, combining reinforcement (silent cues) and escalating alerts. Krzypow, however, worries specifically about OEMs who have requested a hierarchy of drowsiness and distraction levels in their RFQs.This would encompass drowsiness stages from light to severe. Krzpow asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would they do with this information? Are they going to harass the driver at each level?\u00e2\u0080\u009d If so, who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn the DMS off? In his view, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you really want to do is to intervene in the right time that really merits intervention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such an approach would presumably convince drivers to trust the system, leading to a favorable adoption. This strategy would assume much restraint from OEMs who often tend to err on the side of safety. This is where human factors matter and the fusion of DMS and ADAS signals is highly desired. In addition, Cipia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Krzpow noted that once DMS is mandated in Europe, a vehicle will not be registered without a driver monitoring system functioning in it. Effectively, that will make DMS no longer a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice-to-have\u00e2\u0080\u009d feature. Instead, DMS becomes a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust-have\u00e2\u0080\u009d feature with no ability for consumers to turn it off. Drivers will not be asked whether they want this feature in the vehicle. The driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negative experience with DMS, of course, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmight lead consumers to favor \u2018less annoying\u2019 brands,\u201d he added. \u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
