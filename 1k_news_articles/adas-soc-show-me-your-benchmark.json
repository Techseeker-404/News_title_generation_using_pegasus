But how can the rest of us\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 reporters, analysts and most important, carmakers\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 tell one ADAS SoC from another? Truth is, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The absence of scientific tools and benchmarks leaves little choice but to take the vendor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word for it. Or we rely on such imperfect measures as trillion operations per second (TOPS) to compare Intel/Mobileye\u2019s EyeQ5 with Nvidia\u2019s Xavier, which is probably a bum steer. About a month ago, EEMBC, an industry consortium that develops benchmarks for embedded hardware,\u00a0rolled out \u201cADASMark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an autonomous driving benchmark suite, which is now available for licensing. The new tool suite, according to EEMBC, is designed to help tier ones and carmakers to optimize their use of compute resources ranging from CPU to GPU and hardware accelerators when they design their own ADAS systems.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about frameworks EE Times caught up with Peter Torelli, EEMBC president and CTO, to ask about challenges automakers face as they set out to design highly automated vehicles. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that more and more automotive embedded systems deploy multiple cores. However, as Torelli pointed out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are still very few frameworks that can utilize their asymmetric compute resources.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout a framework, every instance of the compiled benchmark would vary dramatically depending on the hardware, and make comparisons across platforms extremely difficult. Frameworks facilitate portability with very little modification.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Consider the ADASMark Pipeline below, he said.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 (Source: EEMBC) "}
