One question is what Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s withdrawal from the European Union will mean for U.K.-China trade. To get a better handle on this important trade relationship, both as it stands now and how it may evolve, EE Times met with Syrus Lohrasb, CEO of the China-Britain Business Fusion Group. The consultancy assists both U.K.- and Chinese-based companies with their respective market-entry plans, helping build relationships with decision makers within the respective target countries. The company provides assistance with everything from real estate to equity investment and even the educational needs of employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 children. It is thus well positioned to provide a comprehensive perspective on Brexit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implications. The Chinese government regards developing market sectors more favorably than legacy technologies and businesses. Areas of focus include artificial intelligence, robotics, alternative energy, and electric vehicles. For example, Lohrasb said, Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval of a plan to make China the global leader in AI by 2030 has created additional opportunities in that sector. EE Times: One issue in China is uneven development. Money is being applied in irregular places, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got infrastructure in some places that is very advanced, while in nearby places the infrastructure is a legacy from the \u00e2\u0080\u009860s. How does that affect doing business with China?  Syrus Lohrasb: I think that when you do business with China, you need to travel extensively throughout the country and find out what that beautiful country is all about. You will come across a very ancient culture, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll understand that this culture is deep-rooted. You will begin to understand that some of that culture needs to be preserved. It may be outdated \u2026 but there is a reason behind it. There is balance. When the Chinese government talks about a harmonious society, they truly mean it. You cannot have [just] an advanced society in terms of electronics and machinery and the future when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve still got a very strong past. You need to create a balance between the two within the society. EET: In light of that, do you see Brexit through the eyes of the Chinese as a risk or an opportunity? Lohrasb: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great opportunity for the Chinese, and we can see that already in a number of sectors. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer about buying football clubs; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more about innovation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more about technology. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more about things like the purchase of U.K. chip designer Imagination [in September] for \u00c2\u00a3550 million [$726 million] by a Chinese private-equity firm. [Imagination was valued at] \u00c2\u00a3600 million back on June 23 of last year. So, you can see where Brexit has had an impact with respect to M&A deals. A cool savings of \u00c2\u00a350 million is big attraction for the Chinese. On challengesEET:\u00c2\u00a0Having said that, what are some of the challenges you see? Lohrasb:\u00c2\u00a0I think there are concerns that the U.K. is losing some of its prime assets, not just to the Chinese but also to other countries. The challenge is to make sure that although there is what is perceived to be a loss of assets, a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operation continues to create jobs and prosperity for United Kingdom. This is a challenge, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not looking at a company that comes in, strips assets, and takes them back to their home country. Development of operations in the U.K. is a challenge. Obviously, Brexit has caused a lot of uncertainty, especially in the financial services [sector], which is the jewel in the crown, so to speak, in the U.K. And financial services have a tech dimension. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to preserve these prime assets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or the Square Mile, as they say, in the City \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and make sure that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not impacted very badly. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think the challenge is how to do that, and I think there are solutions that Prime Minister [Theresa May] is looking at in terms of passporting, in terms of staying in single markets, in terms of meeting a transitional period where Britain will have a respite in organizing itself. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question of money. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming down to money now, and how much the U.K. has to pay to get out of the European Union. But I always say the United Kingdom needs to be part of a continent. We are not part of Africa; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not part of Asia; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not part of America. We have to be part of Europe. And we continue to do this [despite Brexit]. We continue to build friendship with the Europeans. \u00c2\u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
