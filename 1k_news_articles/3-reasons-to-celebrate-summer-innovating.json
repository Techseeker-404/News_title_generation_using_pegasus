{"Author": "EETimes\u00a0", "Date": "05.18.2018", "Keywords": "", "Article": "    There are three reasons for DIYers, makers and IoT entrepreneurs to celebrate summer innovating. The first of these is Arduino Day, which just passed on May 12, 2018 and marked over 24 hours across the world with events organized by Arduino founders and developers just like you. This was the fifth edition of the official Arduino Day, which was hosted live on YouTube from Milan. The event brought together all sorts of people\u00e2\u0080\u0094including makers, engineers, designers and developers as well as teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0094interested in Arduino, to talk about their projects and experiences as well as offer a learning opportunity for those new to the open-source platform. The Milan event featured four panels focused on IoT, Developers, Education and Makers. Attendees got to meet panelists from Arduino, ARM and Arrow, developers from companies like Intel and entrepreneurs like Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino, the founder of Good Night Lamp. If you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to attend in person, you can check out a collection of summary clips here.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The second reason to celebrate is that Arrow Electronics is giving 20 percent off of an unlimited quantity of all Arduino products until May 25, 2018. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, simply give Arrow your email address and country, and you might win one of 100 MKR IoT Bundles in the sweepstakes. The MKR IoT Bundle will get you started with the basics of using the Arduino MKR1000 for IoT applications.   The bundle includes an Arduino MKR1000 board with header soldered, a micro-USB cable, 400-point breadboard, TMP36 temperature sensor, a tilt sensor, a 16 x 2 alphanumeric LCD, 34 LEDs, a 6-/9-V DC motor, a servo motor, a piezo capsule, an octocoupler and many other commonly needed electronic components, including MOSFETS, diodes, resistors, capacitors, wires and buttons.

And if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet have a design idea, here are three exciting projects that will inspire your creative spirit. Retro games meet Arduino  Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with something that is bound to please the gamer in you: Gamebuino. It is a retro-style portable game console project based on Arduino. While you can immediately get started on the Gamebuino, its library helps you to program your own fully featured 8-bit games in minutes. Its extension ports allow you to add modules, such as accelerometers or wireless communication, as well as connect several consoles for multiplayer games.  The 10-minute clothing care system  Makers with more commercial ambitions will like the Tersa Steam, an Indiegogo campaign with Arrow Certified Technology for a wall-mounted clothing care system. After being funded with $95,208, or 224 percent of its target, last year, it is in the prototyping stage at the time of this writing. It comprises a small cupboard, where you can hang a piece of clothing to be freshened, after which you insert a 3-oz. biodegradable pod containing distilled water and plant-based hydrosols, press a button and wait for 10 minutes. During this time, a blast of steam kills bacteria, smooths out wrinkles and infuses your clothes with the smell of the pod before drying them ready to wear.  Unlimited Tomorrow  If you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet been inspired to tinker, Unlimited Tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s project certainly will. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to deliver affordable prosthetics. Founder Easton LaChappelle plans to do this by offering low-cost 3D scanners and computers to digitally map an amputee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s residual limb and opposite full arm, if they have one. Software under development will automatically create custom mechanical and robotic designs. A network of 3D printers located around the world will output the final product. Both Arduino and Indiegogo are behind Unlimited Tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress from product development to achieving business objectives. When the company partnered with Indiegogo in an equity crowdfunding campaign, it had planned to raise $1.07 million and already has over $1.5 million to achieve its goals, the first of which is to produce 100 of its prosthetics by the end of 2018. Check out the Unlimited Tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video to learn more. Internet of Arduino Challenge  The third reason to rejoice is that you have a chance to take your dream project to market backed by a $50,000 funding from Arrow Electronics. If you have an Arduino-based IoT product in mind, you can apply to join the Internet of Arduino Challenge from May 12 to August 31, 2018. Note the following deadlines:   Email your Bill of Materials by August 31, 2018.   Once engineers at Arrow Electronics certify your technology, tell your network to vote from October 22 through November 4, 2018.   Prepare for the Top 5 innovations to be launched on Indiegogo at least from January 2 to 31, 2019.   The winning Indiegogo campaign will receive $50,000 backing from Arrow on January 11, 2019.   With a microcontroller development ecosystem like Arduino and the engineering and production resources from the Arrow Certification Program, your summer of innovation could turn into a successful product.
