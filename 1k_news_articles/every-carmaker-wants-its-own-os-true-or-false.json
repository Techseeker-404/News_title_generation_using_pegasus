Recognizing that the automotive industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest challenge is software, carmakers, ranging from Volkswagen to Hyundai, have revealed efforts to develop their own OS platform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just like Tesla. This is a tall order, if not outright fantasy. To match Tesla, the issues auto companies face aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about adding over-the-air software updates or finding unique UI software for a digital cockpit. What they need is a full-fledged car OS. Carmakers need a software platform that can address improved whole-car functions and safety, the bailiwick of companies like Tesla, born and bred in Silicon Valley. Late last month, Elektrobit (Erlangen, Germany) unveiled \u00e2\u0080\u009can industry first software platform\u00e2\u0080\u009d called EB xelor. Almost simultaneously, TTTechAuto (Vienna, Austria) announced a software platform for automakers. \u00c2\u00a0Called MotionWise, TTTech describes it as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca series-proven safety software platform for automated driving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d TTTech Auto also announced the establishment of a new unit called \u00e2\u0080\u009cCar.OS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meant to be an extension of MotionWise to help car OEMs develop a car operating system. While there are some differences, both EB xelor and MotionWise platforms would serve to expedite carmaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development of next-generation software and vehicle architecture efficiently and safely.  Recommended  Elektrobit Aims to Reduce Car OEMs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Software Dev Burden The Button Revolution Is Here | On Succession | The Internet of IoT   Elektrobit, a leading embedded software supplier for the automotive industry, noted that EB xelor consists of production-proven software from Elektrobit, in addition to open-source and third-party software. TTTech Auto, which calls its platform \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe safety mastermind for automated driving within a vehicle architecture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained that MotionWise enables platform and software re-use in multiple vehicle lines, its variants and in different models. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Orchestration\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needed Egil Juliussen, a veteran automotive industry analyst, told EE Times that TTTech Auto and Elektrobit are working a similar angle. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re aware that \u00e2\u0080\u009cOEMs, with limited software resources, need help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Consider the smartphone, or any computing system. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUsually, there is one CPU that controls a whole system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed Juliussen. In contrast, an operating system is particularly complicated for car OEMs because \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery car model uses a lot of ECUs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one for different domain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on which different software runs. Taken a whole car, though, a variety of software running on different CPU must work together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stressed. Evolving number of ECUs inside a car demand \u201cservice-oriented architecture with real-time guarantees.\u201d (Source: TTTech Auto) TTTech Auto calls the \u00e2\u0080\u009corchestration\u00e2\u0080\u009d of different software within a system \u201cnecessary.\u201d In an email exchange with EE Times, Stefan Poledna, CTO of TTTech Auto, told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCurrently, we see a clear trend in the software-defined car.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoreover, the rapidly growing software complexity dramatically widens the gap between the industry\u2019s need and capability to develop complex software.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Poledna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view, this widening gap can be closed only by software re-use and adoption of car software platforms such as MotionWise. Both Elektrobit and TTTech Auto are convinced that carmakers should leave the basic plumbing and development of undifferentiated foundational software to embedded software platform experts like themselves. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the future, OEMs will differentiate in the functions they offer to their customers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d predicted Poledna. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese functions will tie up vast resources as they have to be deployed in increasingly fast iteration cycles and have to be safe and secure from the beginning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Time-aware MotionWise architecture (Source: TTTech Auto) Click the image above to enlarge. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OS Tesla hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talked of its home-grown car OS in great detail. But a team of analysts at Frost & Sullivan recently unpacked the OS. They noted that it was built from ground up, enabling Tesla to be more agile in software development. Tesla can distribute better performance and power functionality, and provide better protection of its vehicles from cybersecurity threats by exposing fewer access gateways, according to Sarwant Singh, managing partner in Frost & Sullivan, He wrote recently in his contributed article in Forbes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact all the domains are built-up on that one single OS, reflective of a drastically different approach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Noting that this is something that only tech companies well versed in software can do, he noted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt represents a significant advantage which allows Tesla to have a six to seven years tech advantage vs its nearest rival.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Singh summed up: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing forward, I see every car company trying to develop an OS platform in-house, just like VW is trying (and currently struggling) to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What about RTOS in a vehicle? TTTech Auto, for example, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anticipate a traditional real-time operating system (RTOS) such as QNX going away from vehicles. Nonetheless, RTOS alone can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer the comprehensive software answer modern vehicles are looking for. Poledna pointed out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have seen a need for many additional services that are sitting on top of our middleware with a strong potential for re-use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d TTTech Auto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly established Car.OS unit is tasked with a mission to develop \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best-in-class car operating system\u00e2\u0080\u009d for carmakers. Poledna explained that TTTech Auto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upcoming Car.OS system can run on top of QNX as well as with other real-time operating systems, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will continue to work with ecosystems and partnerships.\u00e2\u0080\u009d TTTech Auto is ready to offer programming service routines that will bring numerous benefits to the OEM, he noted. Last month, Hyundai claimed in its press release that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartnership with Nvidia enables Hyundai to roll out the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new ccOS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hyundai said ccOS stands for \u00e2\u0080\u009cconnected car operating system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and claimed it was developed in-house. When asked about Hyundai, Poledna declined to comment, noting that he can\u2019t discuss any developments, currently underway at OEMs, of car operating systems. However, he stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA major advantage of TTTech Auto\u2019s Car.OS solution is that we are open to all OEMs and Tier One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as a neutral software company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d TTTech Auto notes that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just offering a new operating system for carmakers. It claims a solution that enables \u00e2\u0080\u009ca strong re-use potential and synergies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a platform flexible enough to \u00e2\u0080\u009cincorporate OEM-specific features,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Poledna added. For instance, TTTech Auto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform will \u00e2\u0080\u009cenable testing in the cloud which corresponds 100% to behavior in the vehicle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Poledna pointed out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will be able to ensure completely realistic testing for software-in-the-loop even in hyper real-time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Perhaps more significantly, the company is making it possible for such processes to run on \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplex multi-SoC and multi SoC ECUs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Real-time guarantee The most significant element of MotionWise, TTTech Auto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flagship software platform designed for automated driving, might be its real-time guarantee. MotionWise delivers \u00e2\u0080\u009cglobally available services with guaranteed latency, regardless of the system load,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company explained. Its key features include: \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime-aware\u00e2\u0080\u009d platform architecture, end-to-end guarantees across a heterogeneous environment, safe, automated execution of the system and real-time processing with deterministic scheduling.  The MotionWise platform also offers \u00e2\u0080\u009cstandardized interfaces for applications by introducing the AUTOSAR-compliant, multi-SoC platform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while abstracting hardware and operating systems. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSafety by design\u00e2\u0080\u009d is another facet. MotionWise ensures \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstant availability and the highest levels of performance for mission-critical functions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company claimed. The platform \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrings freedom from interference to any system in line with the highest safety standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whether Elektrobit or TTTech Auto, these software platform suppliers are hoping to enable car OEMs to develop their own software-defined cars.
