{"Author": "Luffy Liu, Associate chief analyst of EETimes China\u00a0", "Date": "04.11.2019", "Keywords": "Geography, Semiconductor Design & Manufacturing", "Article": "  China is making progress becoming less reliant on foreign supply of semiconductors, according to Chinese IC industry executives, but the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts still require setting specific intermediate goals and prioritizing those goals. The executives discussed these issues during a recent roundtable event called \u201cCountdown: How Far is China from 40% IC Self-Sufficiency?\u201d held during the 2019 China IC Leader Summit, jointly organized by AspenCore\u2019s EETimes China, EDN China, and ESM China Electronic Business . China has been the largest consumer of integrated circuits (ICs) since 2005. In 2015, the State Council of China adopted an ambitious plan for the China electronics industry to become self-reliant. The \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan set a strategic goal to grow the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IC industry to achieve a self-sufficiency rate of 40% by 2020, increasing to 70% by 2025. Three years later, China was importing more chips, not fewer. According to the 2018 National Imported Key Commodity Value Index, published by the State General Administration of Customs, China imported 417.57 billion integrated circuits in 2018, with a total amount of RMB 2058.41 billion (US $312 billion), an increase of 19.8% over 2017. This is the first time that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IC imports have exceeded US $300 billion. Which markets should China try to win? What are the obstacles to China achieving chip self-sufficiency? Given that China lacks internal sources for basic device IP, electronic design automation (EDA) tools, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, how can China create a path to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency? The guests from the Chinese semiconductor industry at the 2019 China IC Leader Summit roundtable discussed the unavoidable problems encountered in the development of China\u2019s IC industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and offered advice from various perspectives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on how to proceed with developing a home-grown industry. Which Markets Must be Won? With the goal of improving self-sufficiency, which areas must be won by the domestic semiconductor industry chain? Dr. Wayne Dai, VeriSilicon CEO, believes that the key is to solve the bottlenecks, such as the huge amount of memory products required. Andy Miao, deputy general manager and technical director of Shenzhen Micro Semicon agreed that in the storage market, China is making good progress, but this is a market that is easier to break into. By contrast, microcontroller (MCU) is a US $20 billion market, 99% of which is still in the hands of international manufacturers. If Chinese companies are to reduce their reliance on imports, it will be a long-term process, including upgrading the level of analog technology and quality control, he said. \u00a0  Andy Miao, deputy general manager and technical director of Shenzhen Micro Semicon \u00a0 Invest in Foreign Tech, Keep it Low-Key Miao also pointed out that the premise of the 40% self-sufficiency rate is that China would gain control of the technology needed in order to vault ahead, which could include directly purchasing foreign technology. However, the IC industry is a strategic technology for all countries, ownership is politically sensitive, and it is best to act low-key in terms of investments and acquisitions. \u201cAt present, our most important goal is to accumulate basic skills, put the numbers aside, take it step-by-step, don\u2019t rush success,\u201d Miao said. YanQiu Xia, director of strategy and business development of HiSilicon, believes that the 40% figure is more of a guideline from the government. It is still necessary to achieve results, however, and each company must set its own goals. \u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like when parents want their children to be admitted to a prestigious school. Can they all be right? Parents can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decide, but they have to rely on their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal drive. Just like a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal, perhaps it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be 60%. So why do you stick to 40%?\u201d Xia said. \u201cIf a company starts from 0% and reaches 10%, it has already achieved great success \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it should not be a goal set for a specific company. Enterprises should upgrade their own competitiveness, continuously evolve and develop, and strive to achieve this result.\u201d Su Weimin, chairman of the ZigBee Member Group China, spoke from the perspective of standards bodies. \u201cThe chip is the basis of communication. Although 14 chip manufacturers are currently certified by the ZigBee Alliance worldwide, only one Chinese company is certified,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Weimin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNonetheless, in the field of communications, Chinese chip manufacturers have made significant progress.\u201d Wei Xu, secretary of the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Industry Association (SICA) and executive vice president of Shanghai HHGrace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, hopes that the cooperation among electronics companies in China will bring about an increase in the self-sufficiency rate of chips. \u201cThe IC industry chain is very long, from design, manufacturing, packaging, testing, to materials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no single country that can dominate the world. China should consider the integrity and construction of the industrial chain, but in a completely closed environment. The country began to build fabs in 2014, so [there is progress] from the perspective of capacity. In 2020, the localization rate of chips will make great progress.\u201d \u00a0  Wei Xu, secretary of SICA and executive vice president of Shanghai HHGrace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. \u00a0 Open Up \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo Man\u2019s Land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Innovation is King There might be an opportunity for Chinese electronics companies to compete with foreign manufacturers by joining them at the starting line of the \u201cno man\u2019s land\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 markets that are still so new. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) and driverless vehicles are markets in which industry market standards are relatively in their infancy. Can China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industry exploit this opportunity to develop its own chip architecture and related technological ecosystem? Dai said it could be profitable to look for opportunities at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cedges\u00e2\u0080\u009d of markets. For example, he believes that smart audio and wireless headphones could be an entry point. For example, wireless headphones can also be used as hearing aids. These new products are not yet widely available, they have bright prospects, and would represent large quantities. Xu said that in the post-Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law era, application drivers could be an advantage for the Chinese electronics industry. China could leverage its huge internal market to set worldwide trends and determine the standards of the whole world. Future applications include areas such as smart cities and healthcare. A country with a large population is likely to do this in a creative mindset or atmosphere. Miao agreed with Dai and Xu \u00e2\u0080\u0094 look for opportunities on the edges. The biggest driving force for all design innovations comes from the terminal\u2019s performance and system requirements. China is very successful as a manufacturing country. Huawei, for example, creates Internet of Things (IoT) platforms and is big enough to set its own standards. \u00a0   \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce a certain standard is formed, Chinese companies have a good chance to achieve leadership,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miao noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEspecially in the field of home appliances and industrial control, IoT will land first. This is the most direct place for human-computer interaction, and it is also the best field for Chinese manufacturers, including Haier, Midea, and Gree. Gree\u2019s home appliances have already taken the lead in the world. \u201cSystems and home appliance manufacturers need to cooperate with chip manufacturers in optimizing their systems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miao continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChip manufacturers can help them improve system integration and reduce costs.\u201d He believes these companies will set new standards for the market. Would these new standards apply only to the Chinese market, or could China set standards for the global industry? Xia thinks that it is first necessary to determine where standards-setting power comes from. Historically, the Chinese government has participated in formal standards activities only in the IC industry. The supply chain in the communications industry is dispersed, however. Consequently, individual corporate standards could influence the progress of this industry. \u00a0  YanQiu Xia, director of strategy and business development of HiSilicon \u00a0 Initiative Gets the Lead \u201cFor example, Apple dared to cancel the earphone hole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Xia said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHuawei also changed the specifications of the memory card before. This is not what any government agency or industry organization forced them to do, but they took the initiative to do something to lead the industry. Other manufacturers follow.\u201d Unilateral action does not automatically translate into market leadership, however. Sometimes other manufacturers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow another company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead. \u201cSeveral top manufacturers may not agree. For example, Midea and Haier might not agree to the same standard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Xia said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoever becomes the real standard depends on the outcome of market competition.\u201d There are too many games involved in this, which is one of the reasons why so many people use Google\u2019s tensor processing unit (TPU). Few are concerned about Google\u2019s ability to continue leading the market. Meanwhile, a small company that open sources something might produce an innovative product, but it still might not get market traction. It\u2019s not because the product isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the suspicion that a small company might not have the resources to continue innovating in the next year, the next year, and the year after that. Xia added, \u201cSo when we set standards for new fields, don\u2019t think about not following international mainstream manufacturers at all. No one believes that Chinese manufacturers can defeat Apple or Google within 10 years, but we must aim at our own five-year plan. The goal is high, the action will not be deterred when the competition leads the entire industry chain to establish their so-called standards, in order to continue to compete with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weimin also believes that an emphasis on national autonomy might not be the most effective strategy in the context of globalization. Some domestically-enforced standards have forced Chinese companies to neglect cooperation with the international community. In a closed system, a country or an enterprise can set a standard. For example, the China high-speed railway system operates largely on its own. \u00a0  Su Weimin, Chairman of the ZigBee Member Group China \u00a0 Bold Cooperation Sets Standards\u00c2\u00a0 According to Weimin, \u201cIf Chinese companies can achieve leadership in a certain field, they should boldly cooperate with international companies, or establish a business alliance to set standards and directly target international companies. Conversely, if a company is in a weak position doing one\u2019s own standard will hurt the company.\u201d Senhua Dong, deputy general manager of Empyrean Software Co. Ltd., believes that AI is just an enabling technology that can be used in different chips and systems. On the application side, it is more suitable for China\u2019s development stage, because China has a huge market. Talking about China surpassing the United States in AI actually has a negative effect on the healthy development of the industry. \u201cIf we step back and think about it, we will find that most of the basic algorithms for AI are still in the hands of the United States. From a technical point of view, we are still in a relatively weak position,\u201d Dong said. \u201cBut from the perspective of applications and market, China\u2019s large number of home appliances and system manufacturers have strong demand, which can provide many improvements for our AI algorithm and chip design. This creates a synergistic combination can drive the development of domestic AI technology.\u201d Liansheng Cao, vice president of Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. (AMEC), expressed his views from the perspective of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cno-man\u2019s land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He believes that China\u2019s entire IC industry is still catching up with market leaders, with a few exceptions that include Huawei. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this kind of ecosystem, can IC practitioners have original things?\u201d Cao went on to say, \u201cI understand the no-man\u2019s land has two forms. One is \u2018there is no one that I can chase who is better than me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then the question is: what should I do now? The other is the idea of \u00e2\u0080\u0098completely original,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which is especially important for young people in the industry. Don\u2019t give up the spark of innovation. It\u2019s very difficult, but very valuable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Unavoidable IP Problem The main battlefield is that ICs are still in high demand everywhere, including general-purpose processors and analog devices. The competition between Chinese and foreign manufacturers comes down to intellectual property (IP), and the unavoidable conclusion is that while China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electronics industry has developed some IP, it is still lagging far behind its international competitors. As a well-known IP supplier in China, Dai also said that there are actually some areas in which China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IP is leading, such as video transcoding in the cloud and network chips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a top US company that found us and said that we can customize their low-power chips. Why are they looking to us? Because our transcoding and coding have been the best in the world. Our chip has four times the original power. The power consumption is only 1/30th . After that, several large IoT companies in China asked for this IP,\u201d Dai said. \u00a0  Wayne Dai, VeriSilicon CEO \u00a0   IP is a Long-Term Effort\u00c2\u00a0 Dai said, \u201cThe Internet model is easy to learn, but doing IP requires a long-term struggle. It is not easy to cultivate in 8 or 10 years. We have seen some slow improvement, but it take its time. Why is the first word in \u00e2\u0080\u0098Science and Technology Innovation Board\u00e2\u0080\u0099 science? It is to focus on the long-term accumulation of hard technology, rather than the Internet business model.\u201d Miao has worked in IP for 16 years. \u201cI know how hard it is to evolve IP every year, how to focus on one thing, and how difficult it is to lead the industry,\u201d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike the MCU industry, most of the key technical performance issues are related to analog performance. Chinese companies lack the accumulation of knowledge in this area. But I see more and more people and companies joining the industry. There are a lot of applications in China. With the demand built into the system, IP may be one step ahead of others and gain a leading position in certain specific projects.\u201d Michael E. Porter, in his book The Competitive Advantage of Nations , discussed the importance of industrial clusters. He observed that forming such clusters is the most efficient way to create self-sufficiency in a market. Miao also hopes that the investment in China\u2019s IC industry will help develop a Chinese cluster \u00e2\u0080\u0094 make the market more concentrated and encourage the creation of a home-grown talent pool, which will promote the IC industry, including IP development. \u00a0  Senhua Dong, deputy general manager of Empyrean Software Co., Ltd. \u00a0 Give Domestic EDA Vendors a Fair Chance Outside of China, the stranglehold firms have on technology is not only in basic IP. At present, 95% of China\u2019s EDA market is controlled by foreign enterprises. Empyrean Software is the leading EDA supplier based in China. Dong noted that the EDA industry is 60 years old, while Empyrean is only 10 years old this year. China has to acknowledge there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a gap in experience. Dong said, \u201cTo develop China\u2019s EDA, we must first have strategic positioning. For example, Empyrean \u2018s full-market operation has hardly taken any support from the state in the past 10 years, because we firmly believe that the development of China\u2019s integrated circuits will definitely bring opportunities to EDA. One is to strengthen cooperation with domestic OEMs. For example, the cooperation between Empyrean and Huawei is very close. China\u2019s IC industry demand has driven China\u2019s own EDA innovation. This kind of industrial chain cooperation is very important.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Xia believes that Chinese industry should not automatically support domestic EDA tools simply because they are from China. The Chinese factory must practice non-discriminatory sourcing. American companies suspect that Chinese buyers reflexively support the Chinese manufacturers, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what Chinese buyers believe. In many cases, Chinese companies are actually giving priority to foreign products because they are mature and easy to use. It is important to develop domestically-produced tools, but the market requires that Chinese suppliers get no special support \u00e2\u0080\u0094 local suppliers must compete fairly with foreign EDA tools. From the market perspective, the monopoly that foreign EDA suppliers have is not good for downstream customers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven for the employees of these international EDA companies, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for them to job-hop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Xia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny country should support new market entrants instead of using national boundaries to limit who can participate or not. This is good for the development of the market, customers, and the entire industry.\u201d Developing a competitive local EDA industry is a long-term goal. Foreign manufacturers started 60 years ago and have developed through hundreds of mergers and acquisitions. It is unrealistic to expect China can become competitive in EDA in three years. Domestic EDA manufacturers must aim at 10 years and 20 years to do it. Production Equipment The situation for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is similar. Advanced equipment has been banned for sale to China. If the availability of production equipment remains a bargaining chip in global trade disputes, how is China to increase the localization rate of chips? As a representative for equipment manufacturers, Cao acknowledge that China\u2019s semiconductor equipment is far from the world\u2019s advanced level, and that has become an important factor restricting China\u2019s semiconductor industry. That said, Chinese companies are becoming competitive. Cao said, \u201cWhen our equipment is good enough, they will remove it from the list of restricted exports. For example, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce went to AMEC, and then went to SMIC the next day, where they saw our equipment running smoothly in SMIC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fab. They removed the equipment from the embargo list six months later.\u201d Cao said, \u201cThe reason is that China has been able to produce enough equipment and good equipment, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer meaningful to continue to limit security in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even though China has made great progress in production equipment after 10 years, the overall situation is still unsatisfactory. Several people have said before that the equipment can be bought without having to spend a lot of money on it. However, after the ZTE incident, the whole country has a unified understanding. Cao believes that the key to localization of equipment is the collaboration of upstream and downstream of the industrial chain. Downstream, Chinese IC manufacturing enterprises have to be willing to use equipment made by domestic suppliers. \u201cIn fact, we also have this problem. We will often ask ourselves: will we be reluctant to use domestically-produced parts? When we ask manufacturers to use domestically-produced equipment, can we actively help domestic suppliers who provide parts and subsystems for us?\u201d he said. \u201cDomestic companies will encounter this problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cao continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think my product is ready, but no customers want to help me, no customer can tell me the disadvantages of my products.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the past two years, the government has done a lot of work to promote the integration between upstream and downstream, such as letting downstream companies lead the research on some equipment and parts. From the first day, you are tied to the downstream enterprises.\u201d   Developing a competitive local EDA industry is a long-term goal. Foreign manufacturers started 60 years ago and have developed through hundreds of mergers and acquisitions. It is unrealistic to expect China can become competitive in EDA in three years. Domestic EDA manufacturers must aim at 10 years and 20 years to do it. Production Equipment The situation for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is similar.

From the first day, you are tied to the downstream enterprises.\u201d \u00a0  \u00a0 Talent, the Hottest Commodity In the final analysis, the competition in the semiconductor industry is a competition of talent. How will China\u2019s semiconductor be able to build a strong pool of employees and assure a continuously high-quality stream of talent? Huawei has always been regarded as one of the most attractive Chinese companies for talent. It is also the only domestic electronics company with salaries that are comparable to other international giants. Xia believes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone may think that the talent gap is now large and will be better in the future. In fact, if the basic education of talent is not done well, the gap will always exist or even grow wider. The primary school classroom determines national strength. Now, primary school mathematics competition is subject to many restrictions, so how can the industry hope to surpass others?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The second is the issue the treatment of talent. The United States often accuses China of subsidizing certain industries. It accuses China of offering market-based subsidies, rather than investing in research and development. It puts Chinese companies in a bind. If they can use money to apply for a project or buy equipment, but not for pay competitive salaries, how are Chinese companies supposed to attract and keep talent? If China wants to improve the skills of scientific research personnel, it needs to help them on Hukuo (registered residency status), reduce taxes from education, provide medical care and housing, and treat them equally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Xia continued. Miao agreed. He believes that Huawei has become a benchmark in this respect, an example that other Chinese companies should learn from. In 2000, Xia was working at Cisco, and made much more money than employees of Huawei. Huawei was still able to attract talented engineers, however, and now it has surpassed other major international companies, demonstrating how important the incentive system is to the enterprise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 let the good people get better treatment. \u201cWe must also find ways to go abroad. If we cannot attract good foreign engineers to China, we can set up design centers abroad and hire talented local technical engineers in other countries,\u201d Miao said. That said, there are excellent engineers in China, and they need to be supported, agreed Dai. Another part of the problem is that China is not producing enough top-rank engineers to fulfill its own needs. This creates a situation in which Chinese companies are competing with each other to attract top local talent. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Internet companies are making a lot of money, which means they can pay high wages. IC companies cannot always offer competitive salaries, however, which puts them at a disadvantage when trying to attract top talent. Part of the issue is the lack of sufficient protections for IP. Companies and individuals want assurance they will be able to profit from their innovation, specifically so that they can afford to offer competitive salaries. This is why President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang favor strict protection for IP rights and are recommending severe punishments for violations of IP rights. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not for the Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dai. The implication is that Xi and Li are not making promises to mollify the U.S., which has long expressed displeasure about China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to IP. The politicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desire to provide stronger protection for IP is legitimate. Dai said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is to protect the investment in the country and in local R&D companies. Because if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t protect the bottom line, the whole industry will be very bad. In short, if your company makes money, you can pay the employees high wages. Please don\u2019t rely on the state to pay for the salaries.\u201d Dong suggested that we think about talent issues from another angle. Everyone hopes that colleges and universities can train enough talent to fill this gap. Assuming that colleges and universities can train these students, will these students enter the IC industry? Even if students major in engineering, even in semiconductor engineering specifically, it is not certain that they will pursue careers in IC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I was studying in 1997, the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University could enroll two classes a year, and almost graduated 60 students,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dong recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter 10 years, Tsinghua\u00e2\u0080\u0099s micro-houses can only provide one graduating class per year, of less than 30 students. At that time, 70% of the 30 graduates would enter the electronics industry. But that means one-third of those graduates have not entered the IC industry. Why?\u201d It might be the inability to offer competitive salaries. If companies can\u2019t offer the same salary as Internet and AI companies, they can\u2019t make it. Worse, the integrated circuit industry in China is located in several relatively concentrated areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 places where the cost of living is high. \u201cThe only way is to make your business more profitable and to invest that money in research and development. That is the key to solving this problem.\u201d Dong said, \u201cHuawei is now the only one that can challenge the Internet companies with competitive salaries, so they can attract more students and professionals to enter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    A roundtable discussion, titled \u201cCountdown: How Far is China from 40% IC Self-Sufficiency?\u201d was held during the 2019 China IC Leader Summit. The event was organized by Aspencore\u2019s EETimes China, EDN China and ESM China Electronic Business.  \u00a0      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
