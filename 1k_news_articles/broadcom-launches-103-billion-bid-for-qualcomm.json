Broadcom said it would offer $70 per share to acquire Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, a 28 percent premium over Qualcomm\u2019s closing stock price on Nov. 2, the day before reports that Broadcom was planning a takeover offer surfaced. Broadcom did not approach Qualcomm to discuss the deal prior to launching the bid, according to reports. The magnitude of the deal would be difficult to overstate, even in a period of unprecedented consolidation for the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm itself is still in the process of trying to close a deal for European chip maker NXP Semiconductors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first announced a year ago \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is to date the largest announced semiconductor firm acquisition. A combined Qualcomm, NXP and Broadcom could have total semiconductor sales of $40 billion, making it the third largest chip company ahead of TSMC but below Samsung and Intel, according to Rob Lineback of market watcher IC Insights. Such a deal would make 2017 the largest on record in semiconductor mergers with an estimated value of $120 billion including a reported merger proposal between Cavium and Marvell, he added. \u201cThis complementary transaction will position the combined company as a global communications leader with an impressive portfolio of technologies and products,\u201d said Hock Tan, Broadcom\u2019s president and CEO, in a press statement.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Qualcomm said its board of directors would assess the proposal in consultation with financial and legal advisors. The company said it would not comment further on the proposal until the board completed its review. Analysts reached by EE Times expressed some doubts that an acquisition of Qualcomm by Broadcom makes sense or would pass the muster with regulators. \u201cWhile it\u2019s feasible, it would not be possible at this time with the NXP deal under review,\u201d said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. \u201cI also have serious doubts about it, and it would face regulatory scrutiny.\u201d Regulators around the world would closely scrutinize several product areas including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other RF chips, as well as some embedded processing segments if the Qualcomm acquisition includes NXP, said Lineback. Thomas Krause, Broadcom\u2019s chief financial officer, said that given the \u201ccomplementary nature\u201d of the firms\u2019 products \u201cwe are confident that any\u00c2\u00a0regulatory requirements necessary to complete a combination with\u00c2\u00a0Qualcomm\u00c2\u00a0will be met in a timely manner.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 Handel Jones, CEO of International Business Strategies Inc. (IBS), a Los Gatos, Calif.-based consulting firm, said NXP might be what Broadcom is most interested in. \u201cThere would be good synergy between Broadcom and NXP,\u201d he said.
