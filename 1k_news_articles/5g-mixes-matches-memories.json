Handset makers will continue to add more DRAM and flash storage to smartphones regardless of network connections. The memory in 5G network infrastructure will be even more diverse given the many use cases for the next generation of mobile networking. In some cases, existing memories will be sufficient, but there will also be applications that require more powerful memory to meet computing requirements. Environmental and power considerations also come into play, which could mean an opportunity for low-density memories or established technologies that are qualified.   Advances in memory technology reflect a data explosion and the growing need to move processing closer to data. Memory and storage technologies are on parallel tracks, with more workloads being crunched in-memory. We explore the arc of memory technology in our upcoming Memory Technology Special Project.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cDRAM and NAND company executives like to say how the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future will be driven by the next-generation cell phone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jim Handy, principal of Objective Analysis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis time it happens to be 5G.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What tends to happen instead, according to Handy, is the amount of smartphone memory grows steadily despite the transition from one technology to the next. The rationale for moving to next-generation wireless technology is that it gives faster access to web-based content, said Handy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis naturally implies that there will be less need for storage on the handset, yet the amount of NAND always increases. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to reconcile these two.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jim Handy More DRAM also leads to more power consumption, he added, shortening battery life. But 5G will do more than feed video more quickly to smartphones; backbone memory requirements are also about reliability and ruggedness. In some cases, memory requirements for 5G network infrastructure have more in common with automotive and industrial segments than smartphones. The reason is those memory devices need to last quite a while in telecom equipment. Scott Phillips, vice president of marketing at embedded memory vendor Virtium, said very few smartphones currently support 5G. As carriers roll out 5G networks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creating demand for product lines for which [most] didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t foresee huge growth. It\u2019s quite diverse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, 5G will be implemented as a mix of old and new technologies along the backbone all the way back to the data center, Phillips predicted. Mobile backhaul is placing demands on memory, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily the latest DRAM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bridging of the gap between a 4G or an LTE phone and a 5G back haul is where they\u2019re still using some DDR3 or DDR4,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just in connecting smartphones where 5G creates opportunities for different kinds of memory and storage. Autonomous vehicles and factory automation deployments employing AI and machine learning all require a lot of data, said Phillips. \u00e2\u0080\u009c5G can move that data very quickly, but you still need a big memory cache.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That opens opportunities for fast DRAM to move large data sets into networks, including edge devices handling analytics before shipping data to the cloud. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of looking for the needle in the haystack, they\u2019re trying to get rid of the haystack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Phillips. Just as industrial customers are leveraging edge computing, carrier base stations at the edge must be industrial-strength memory, according to the Virtium executive. Depending on where edge data centers are located, they have to be rugged since datacenter cooling and air filtering are impractical. That requirement has spawned more industrial-grade form factors for memory and storage via rugged SSDs. Virtium recently announced a collaboration with SolidRun to incorporate its StorFly M.2 SATA industrial-grade SSDs, DDR4 memory modules and StorKit SSD software in edge computing platforms that run on 5G. Non-volatile memory vendor Macronix reports healthy growth thanks to investments in 5G infrastructure longevity and reliability, said Anthony Le, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marketing chief. Big telecom operators are using a combination of large and small cells, with processors and Ethernet controllers driving the density requirements for NOR flash memory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose systems are up for 10-plus years. They don\u2019t ever come down, and reliability and longevity are ultra-important in those cases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Le. Boot devices store special keys to boost network security. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs these systems come up, security becomes a really big issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Le stressed. Like Virtium, Macronix views 5G as more than just connecting smartphones. Billions of IoT edge devices are likely in industrial and automotive deployments, said Le, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout 5G, you can\u2019t do true autonomous level three, or four, let alone five. You need a much faster network infrastructure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bandwidth and memory requirements will soar as 5G capacity expands. Between efforts by Apple and Samsung, the architecture for memory and connectivity coalesced quickly for smartphones, noted Frank Ferro, senior director of product marketing at Rambus. The company has been working on 5G infrastructure since 2017. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a pretty good window into what kind of memory architectures they\u2019re looking at for some of these 5G infrastructures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For the foreseeable future, 5G will be a smorgasbord of memory options, Ferro predicted, ranging from legacy to advanced technologies depending on the application. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you\u2019re building out 5G, you have a whole change in the way that networks are being used,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Rambus executive said. While 4G was monolithic, 5G includes both logical and virtual networks running more applications directly on edge clouds in data centers. The shift to 5G is looking like general network infrastructure with more than just DDR DRAM; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a role for higher performance graphics DDR DRAM and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), essentially reconfigured and stacked DRAM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can get a heck of a lot of processing now with the HBM in this much smaller footprint\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ferro said. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a spectrum of newer and older, dependable memory across 5G infrastructure, he added, with standard DDR DRAM doing a lot of \u00e2\u0080\u009chousekeeping\u00e2\u0080\u009d functions and HBM handling much higher throughput for AI applications. Overall, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be new memory supplementing old to meet 5G requirements, said Ferro, while also sticking with what works. In some cases, faster memories will be inevitable. That means manufacturing issues must be resolved. Competitors are \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoing to have to figure out a new memory architecture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ferro concluded. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re still kind of loading up our boards with memory now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Articles in this Special Project:  Remote work Spurs Desktop Performance Increases Workstations will demand more memory, but the future all-purpose device may be a smartphone.
