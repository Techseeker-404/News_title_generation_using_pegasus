It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise then that at the Hannover Messe in Germany this week, one of the biggest trade fairs focused on industrial and factory automation, we should see announcements around IoT security. Microprocessor IP provider Arm and IoT cybersecurity company WISeKey were two of the firms talking about what they are doing to help address security concerns. For a major trade show in Germany today, one expects IoT and smart manufacturing to have major attention, especially since Industrie 4.0 was part of a major industrial strategy for Germany first launched in 2011. At that time, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must deal quickly with the fusion of the online world and the world of industrial production. In Germany, we call it Industrie 4.0.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This strategy aimed to ensure an industry fit for future manufacturing in Germany. It supported the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS), IoT and IoT services with an eye to enhance productivity, efficiency and flexibility of production processes and thus economic growth. The Industrie 4.0 strategy has certainly worked in terms of changing both perception and economic growth for the country. On the perception front, just last week, Bryce Elder, a reporter for the UK financial newspaper, the FT, wrote about German manufacturing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite his vision for full factory automation, Elon Musk is sleeping on the factory floor again during his current Model 3 'production hell' woes and tweeting about his underuse of human workforce. We think German OEMs are about to launch an onslaught of attractive and  profitable electric products; we expect them to hit targets. The German (and Japanese) model of a harmonious blend of robot and human, perfected over 100 years of 'kaizen', together with the benefit of Industrie 4.0 will ensure a speedy and efficient production ramp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From an economic growth point of view, data from Boston Consulting Group published in an EU report last year expects productivity benefits of the Industrie 4.0 strategy to be around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac90-150 billion over the next 5-10 years. \u00c2\u00a0It says from being launched as a research agenda in 2011, Industrie 4.0 has moved into mainstream in terms of collaboration and deployment in a very short time-frame. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still early days, the initiative has been successful in transferring research into practice, e.g. by supporting testbeds and a reference architecture. So with Industrie 4.0 coming to maturity, and with the world talking about industry 4.0, smart manufacturing, and the fourth industrial revolution, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a given \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more connected devices and more attention needed to securing those devices. On this front, at Hannover Messe this week, Arm announced it has expanded its integration with IBM Watson IoT, and partnered with Cybertrust and GlobalSign to deliver BYOC (bring-your-own-certificate) flexible IoT security authentication to devices. In a separate announcement, WISeKey announced a partnership with Stimio, a French product developer, to provide end-to-end secure IoT solutions by combining STIM-MOD, Stimio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IoT hardware platform, with WISeKeyIoT, WISeKey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IoT security framework.
