Mentor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 along with customer Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is hoping to change that with the introduction of the LightSuite Photonic Compiler, billed as the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first integrated electrical/photonic layout automation tool, promising to help engineers do in a matter of minutes what otherwise could take weeks when performed manually. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight now, if you want to design a chip with silicon photonics, you need to have a Ph.D.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ashkan Seyedi, a photonics research scientist at HPE, in an interview with EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat works, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not scalable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law running out of steam, chipmakers are eyeing a host of new technologies to enable continued scaling of semiconductors. Integrated silicon photonics is among the most highly touted. The technology has been in development for more than 20 years, and vendors have been shipping discrete photonic ICs for several years. Integration with electronic circuits in the same package has yet to go mainstream, however, and still faces competition from more mature indium phosphide technology.

Seyedi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0ambitious goal is to help silicon photonics reach its potential by helping to enable \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Arm model of silicon photonics\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cultivating and nurturing an ecosystem that runs throughout the supply chain to provide the necessary infrastructure. As a systems company, HPE has the ability to survey the entire supply chain, helping to identify and fill the gaps necessary to push silicon photonics mainstream. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt really requires optimization of the entire supply chain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seyedi.  Recommended  OFC Debates Road to Photonic ICs   A big step forward in Seyedi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimation is LightSuite, which Mentor will be demonstrating later this month at ECOC in Rome and offering for sale beginning Oct. 1. Seyedi claims that the tool will enable chip designers with no background in photonics to integrate photonics into their layouts with minimal instruction. According to Mentor, which has been a subsidiary of Siemens since last year, Lightsuite takes designs described in the Python language and spits out \u00e2\u0080\u009cCorrect by Calibre\u00e2\u0080\u009d layouts ready for fabrication (with the implementation guided and verified by Mentor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Calibre RealTime Custom verification tool).    Lightsuite also uses Calibre RealTime Custom during the inner placement and routing loop, resulting in a layout that is design-rule-correct. The tool also performs \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat-if\u00e2\u0080\u009d analyses on photonics designs. Tom Daspit, Mentor product manager, noted that LightSuite is built on standards including Python, OpenAccess, and iPDK. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know at the time that Python is the programming language of choice for most photonics designers out there, so we got lucky on that one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
