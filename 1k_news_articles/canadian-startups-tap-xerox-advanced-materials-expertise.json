Toronto-area startup AOMS Technologies has tapped into the advanced materials knowledge and expertise of the Xerox Research Centre of Canada (XRCC) to move its integrated industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform from the research stage to product commercialization. In a telephone interview with EE Times, CEO Hamid Alemohammad said that AOMS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success would not be possible without the XRCC. It began its relationship with Xerox in 2015 as part of an incubator for hardware-focused companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 most other incubators in Southern Ontario, such as those in Toronto and Waterloo, tend to be software-focused. But the region also has a strong advanced materials footprint, he said, thanks to the University of Waterloo and McMaster University, home to the federally funded CanmetMATERIALS research center, which has a mandate of developing and deploying technologies to improve all aspects of producing and using value-added products derived from metals and minerals. Since graduating from the incubator program, AOMS is now working with Xerox in its research facility, which has state-of-the-art lab equipment for doing hardware-focused research. AOMS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 platform also has software components, said Alemohammad, but a key part of its IIoT platform is its patented groundbreaking fiber-optic sensing technology. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have our own way of building sensors, and it requires a lot of research and development in the area of advanced materials, process development, material selection, and things like that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00c2\u00a0 These sensors are designed to detect different parameters such as temperature, pressure, moisture, and fire, so they must work in harsh environments. The overall platform helps customers in the environmental, industrial, oil and gas, and construction industries monitor their infrastructure, assets, and processes and make decisions based on the data. AOMS Technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 industrial IoT platform required the development of unique sensors to detect different parameters such as temperature, pressure, moisture, and fire, and access to the facilities of the Xerox Research Centre of Canada enabled it to scale up production without having to invest in its own lab facilities and stay lean.  For AOMS, picking the right location was critical, said Alemohammad, but access to Xerox facilities has kept the startup in one place for three years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you start small, and you want to be lean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult to set up a lab,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd for a hardware company, a lab is a must. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an office and convert it into a lab. It has to be designed for a lab, and that is basically one of the biggest advantages of being at Xerox.\u00e2\u0080\u009d XRCC began offering fee-for-service research and development expertise and infrastructure to external companies to help them scale up and commercialize their technologies in 2012. Two years later, it launched the Advanced Materials Innovation Hub to provide startups with access to a variety of resources and experts to help them move toward commercialization. In 2015, it partnered with the local National Research Council of Canada campus as well and has since collaborated on more strategic research projects around materials for IoT. Last year, it added the Ontario Centres of Excellence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advanced manufacturing sector group to its campus. Paul Smith, vice president and XRCC director, said that most incubators support software companies that need a desk, a computer, and a phone, but a materials-focused business requires a whole range of equipment and skillsets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are a real diverse center where we have a whole range of skillsets, from chemistry to physics to physicists to chemical engineers to material scientists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smith said. The challenge for a hardware startup, particularly an IoT company, is the ability to demonstrate that their printed electronics can be placed on a range of substrates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally beyond the capacity of a university lab, Smith said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey need the capabilities to actually scale up their devices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. The facility also has a dedicated staff to assist clients and access to a tool and die shop if they need access to a specific tool or piece of equipment, said Patricia Hawkins, XRCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manager of strategic partnerships and innovation services. For AOMS in particular, it was important to have access to environmental change to test their technology under different technology. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have the whole ecosystem in place here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hawkins said.
