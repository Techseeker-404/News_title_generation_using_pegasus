Recently, the Northern California chapter of the Electronic Representatives Association (ERA) brought in a NASA leader to talk about how the electronics industry can work with NASA\u2019s Flight Opportunities program to advance the innovation of space technology. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNASA has a $19-billion budget to play with every year, and our program is part of that with a budget of $15 million,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stephan Ord, technology manager for the Flight Opportunities Program at NASA. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe nature of our program is to develop things quickly rather than spending a decade developing hardware. We are more aggressive than what NASA is used to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Astrobotic Technology's autonomous landing system is mounted atop Masten Space Systems' Xombie vehicle prior to launch from the Mojave Air and Space Port. Astrobotic's system is designed to avoid terrain hazards while safely landing a spacecraft at a specific location on an asteroid, moon or planet.

It supports developments in the suborbital and orbital small satellite launch vehicle market in hopes of reducing risks, reducing costs, improving performance, and advancing capabilities.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009c We are very interested in partnering with commercial partners to do technology development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ord said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone wins. You develop it and we get to use it, but you can keep the proprietary intellectual property (IP).\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Organizations from industry, academia and government also have an opportunity to test technology in a space equivalent environment through the use of commercial reusable suborbital launch vehicles, rocket-powered vertical takeoff, vertical landing platforms, high-altitude balloons, and parabolic aircraft flights. \u00c2\u00a0This is critical as space offers a very different environment than earth. \u00c2\u00a0For example, on earth, heat rises, but in space it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf an organization intends to put technology into space, you can only get so far on earth since the vacuum, radiation, heat transfer, zero gravity, and other realities effect the outcomes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ord. \u00e2\u0080\u009c We provide a space environment for folks to test their technology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The program aims to stimulate small launch vehicle efforts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty to be done in the commercialization of rockets, but beyond that there are rockets that go to the edge of space and eject a payload. There are many innovative things going on to think about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Flight Opportunities program points to a trend toward commercialization for NASA in hopes of creating a win/win for both government and industry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNASA is working more toward commercialization than ever before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ord. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever commercial folks can produce we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compete with them. We hope that it creates enough competition to lower prices in a way that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen in a one-company industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 The program also awards funding to U.S. companies with a promising technology to encourage the industry-led effort of small spacecraft development.
