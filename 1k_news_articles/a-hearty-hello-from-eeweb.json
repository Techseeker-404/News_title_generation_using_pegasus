The idea was to let you know about all of the cool content that\u2019s posted daily on EEWeb.com. Well, all I can said is that a lot of Pooh Sticks have passed under the bridge since that column, not the least that we\u2019ve just posted our July Cartoon Punchline Competition.  It\u2019s up to you to suggest the caption for the final frame. The author of the winning punchline will receive a full-size, full-color print of the cartoon adorned with their winning caption and signed by the artist (Click Here to see the winning punchline for the June competition). As an aside, you can only imagine my surprise and delight to discover that today\u2019s word-of-the-day on Dictionary.com is \u201cgobsmacked.\u201d Although this may sound a tad aggressive, it\u2019s really just an informal way we British use to convey the fact that we are utterly astounded or astonished. Just seeing this word and letting it roll around my noggin makes me nostalgic and long to hear British English (as opposed to the American English subset) tickling my ears again. But we digress\u2026 Returning to the present, we have a treasure trove of interesting and thought-provoking columns as shown below. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re busy, but why not quickly scan the following titles to see if anything calls out to you and grabs your attention.  Tortuously Tricky Technical Problems What! Really?
