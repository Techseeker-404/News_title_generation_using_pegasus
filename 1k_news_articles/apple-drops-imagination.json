Imagination disclosed the Apple cutoff\u00c2\u00a0on Monday\u00c2\u00a0(April 3).\u00c2\u00a0 For the U.K.-based graphics IP firm, whose GPU core technologies have been intrinsic to Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches, this is undoubtedly a devastating blow. However, members of the GPU community, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been aware of Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hiring binge on GPU talent, tend to regard this as an inevitable development.\u00c2\u00a0 Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, noted that he does not think Imagination can continue\u00c2\u00a0as an independent company without Apple. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expect it will be for sale, especially at the lower stock price.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Imagination\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggle has been publicly known for some time. Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagination has been losing design wins to ARM and Vivante, and the acquisition of MIPS has not helped the company. Like MIPS, the competition in GPUs became more competitive and the company became complacent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Legal battle emerging? When Imagination made the announcement\u00c2\u00a0Monday, the graphics core licensor framed the news as \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiscussions with Apple regarding license agreement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Imagination said Apple\u2019s notification had triggered talks on alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement.\u00c2\u00a0 In its press release, Imagination quoted Apple, saying that [Apple] \u00e2\u0080\u009chas been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Imagination, however, also made it clear that it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics\u00e2\u0080\u009d without violating Imagination\u2019s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. In other words, there might be a legal battle ahead. Tirias Research\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Krewell agreed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do expect Imagination will look for legal remedies and I agree it\u2019s very difficult to build a new GPU without infringing on patents held by Imagination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He speculated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis could be the start of negotiation between Apple and Imagination for how much Imagination\u2019s IP is worth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost power and memory bandwidth sensitive mobile GPU use tile-based, deferred rendering and Imagination has some patents, but so do AMD, ARM, and NVIDIA.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has been a long time coming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Krewell said. Because GPUs are abstracted by API like DirectX, OpenGL, and Vulkan,\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cone GPU\u00c2\u00a0can be replaced with a functionally equivalent GPU,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Krewell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt happens in PCs all the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, however, the GPU inside an SoC is harder to replace. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be done, though. \u201cVendors like Samsung and MediaTek have\u00c2\u00a0used both\u00c2\u00a0ARM\u2019s Mali with Imagination PowerVR,\u201d he noted. Apple\u2019s modifying Power VR IP It\u2019s been rumored that Apple has been developing internal graphics technology for many years.\u00c2\u00a0 Krewell said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u2019s believed that the GPU in\u00c2\u00a0Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s A series of SoC processor have\u00c2\u00a0been using\u00c2\u00a0Apple\u00c2\u00a0designed logic\u00c2\u00a0in the GPU building on, but modifying, PowerVR IP.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his view, \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple may have reached the point where it can replace even the basic PowerVR IP with its own designs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d David Kanter, president of Real World Technologies, first published last October his own analysis entitled \u201cA Look Inside Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Custom GPU for the iPhone.\u201d In that piece, Kanter wrote: After years of recruiting graphics architects, Apple has designed its own custom GPU, which is already shipping in the A8, A9, and A10 processors that power the iPhone 6, 6S, and 7. The GPU in Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s processors still retains some fixed-function hardware from PowerVR, but based on publicly available evidence it is clear that the shader core in Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GPU is architecturally very different from Imagination Technologies PowerVR line. This further implies that Apple wrote its own Metal and OpenGL ES compiler for its GPUs and almost certainly wrote the entire driver as well. Next page: Smoking gun?
