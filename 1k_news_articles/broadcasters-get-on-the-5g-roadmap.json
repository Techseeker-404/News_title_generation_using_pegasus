The 3GPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s schedules for wireless standard development are subdivided into generations, phases, and releases. The creation of SA 5G NR simultaneously concludes Phase 1 of the 5G standards process, and\u00c2\u00a0Release 15. With these standards, network service providers can start trialing 5G broadband. As they proceed, the industry will undoubtedly find \u00e2\u0080\u009cbits and pieces to finish, things to correct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said vice president of technical standards at Qualcomm, Lorenzo Casaccia in an interview with\u00c2\u00a0EDN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe core technology is there, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you need to move into trials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The completion of SA 5G NR moves the industry into Phase 2 of 5G standards development, and also the commencement of the multi-part Release 16. The roadmap shows Release 16 beginning at the end of 2017, but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until the 3GPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent meeting in June (in San Diego) that anything specific was decided.\u00c2\u00a0 Continue reading this story on EDN.
