We acknowledge its place in the world as a huge market, a colossal population, and a source of products that pour into our markets in often overwhelming volume at astounding speed. But when we focus on why China does what it does \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and who makes its decisions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the awakened dragon of the Far East remains a mystery to most of us. Once you step inside China and talk to a few folks, including local executives, colleagues, suppliers, competitors, shopkeepers or taxi drivers, China begins to form \u00e2\u0080\u009cfaces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even though they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide full understanding of everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on. This is what happens when we travel, not just to curious tourists and reporters like me, but also the preoccupied head honchos at global companies. Aspencore, publisher of EE Times, brought a bunch of these honchos together this month at the inaugural Global CEO Summit in Shenzhen. I was one of the lucky participants, thrilled to see 1,000 people packed into a huge hotel ballroom. The event was also broadcast live.

I wanted them to benefit even more from their face-to-face meetings\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 in casual settings over cocktails, coffee, lunch and dinner \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with fellow CEOs and speakers. In these contacts, clients, partners, customers and even rivals begin to recognize one another as people beyond their titles and executive roles. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chance to size them up and share ideas and argue or agree instead of thinking of these corporate peers in solely transactional terms. For a lowly reporter like myself, this conference was a chance to gather up \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep background\u00e2\u0080\u009d about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 or not going on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the industry I cover. I found two CEOs from Europe who had to go all the way to Shenzhen to meet each other face-to-face for the first time. I overheard CEOs rather humbly asking for introductions to other executives, and I spotted several of them huddled at the bar at the end of the night, although I had no idea what they were talking about. It was like summer camp for suits.

I came across clues about the areas in which China is looking for potential investment and is worrying about the tightening of foreign investment\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially from China\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 into U.S. companies. There was lots of talk about how the U.S.-China trade war is already affecting their customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 customers.\u00c2\u00a0 For example, in the executive round table I moderated at the Summit, many panelists tried hard not to dwell on the escalating tension between China and the Trump White House. They insisted that they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worried. Yet, privately over cocktails, our Taiwan EE Times editor confirmed that the trade war, despite its limited impact on data centers in the United States, is already prompting server makers to consider moving production facilities out of China. \u00c2\u00a0 A Taiwan memory maker, for example, acknowledged that its customers making PC motherboards and servers are planning to save costs by moving their manufacturing back to Taiwan or to ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia or Indonesia. But this is easier said than done. Some of these companies aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly satisfied with the infrastructure and the pool of qualified laborers in ASEAN countries.

(Photo: Aspencore)  Not just CFIUS, but now FIRRMA  Others brought up the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new \u00e2\u0080\u009crigorous review system\u00e2\u0080\u009d aimed primarily at preventing Chinese access to sensitive American technology. While the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is concerned with M&A activities, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) is a new vehicle that will allow the U.S. to block a much broader array of foreign transactions deemed threats to national security. These include \u00e2\u0080\u009cminority stakes\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cjoint ventures\u00e2\u0080\u009d in technology, telecommunications and other cutting-edge companies. As one VC explained to me in Shanghai, this regulation could have a chilling effect on U.S. businesses seeking foreign investment and might erect more hurdles for transactions. On one hand, Xilinx CEO Victor Peng boasted during cocktails about his company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent acquisition of DeePhi Technology Co., a Beijing-based machine- learning startup. His point was that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not China investing in the U.S., but the other way around. On another hand, newer and broader restrictions on Chinese investment in U.S. companies will likely make it more difficult for U.S. and Chinese companies to deal in one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high-tech sectors. Seismic changes in the electronics industry  This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Global CEO Summit took place not only during heightened political tension between the U.S. and China, but while the semiconductor industry is undergoing seismic changes. A host of transformative events affecting the electronics industry include the substantial slowdown of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law, calls for heterogeneous integration, the limited availability of finer geometry in CMOS process technologies, the proliferation of AI where conventional computer architecture no longer holds, the collapse of an abstraction layer that used to separate software from hardware architecture, the emergence of RISC-V (ARM won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the only game in town),\u00c2\u00a0 and the rapid growth of electronics content in EVs and AVs. The confluence of these fundamental shifts in the industry presents China with a clean slate and clear field to achieve equal status with the West, even if it fails to totally leapfrog its Western rivals. For companies in the United States and in Europe, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunity poses a critical need to devise new strategies, form new alliances and find a path to collaborate with Chinese engineering community. At the very least, Western companies must resolve to at least understand China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions not as an inscrutable monolith, but one Chinese company at a time.

But as the Shenzhen Summit proved, meeting fellow engineers and executives in China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not to mention the odd cab driver (who can now talk to you via translate app on their phone) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a far more effective way to move from speculation to action. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Junko Yoshida, Global Co-Editor-In-Chief, AspenCore Media, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times    "}
