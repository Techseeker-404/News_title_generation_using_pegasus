We often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe marketing claims, especially when we hear marketing buzzwords being tossed around. After all, marketers talk funny.            Creative Electron CEOBill Cardoso      When San Diego-based Creative Electron announced this week that its TruView Parts Counter now uses AI, I wondered if it really  used AI or if the marketers had simply rebranded an existing feature by calling it AI. To find out, I spoke with Creative Electron CEO Dr. Bill Cardoso by telephone.    Cardoso, who holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, started by thanking me for questioning if his product uses AI. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to use \u00e2\u0080\u0098AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to describe our product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new feature because I have an allergic reaction to marketing claims, but the marketers won,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Cardoso went on to explain how the AI works.    The TruView Parts Counter is used by manufacturers to count the number of parts on a reel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first when the parts arrive, then as they are used so that the manufacturer can track costs. One reel can be used multiple times for supplying components to the same or different PCB designs. Unfortunately, people drop parts when loading and unloading reels, making counts inaccurate.             TruView system(Click to enlarge)      \u00e2\u0080\u009cTypically parts counters would count the number of parts on a reel by winding the strips from one reel to another and counting the rotations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cardoso. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe wanted a faster method, so we designed a vision system that could look at the side of a reel and detect the parts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The vision system, according to Cardoso, was good at detecting capacitors but not so good at identifying parts in SOT-23 packages such as transistors and diodes. It was even worse when trying to identify connectors because of their different shapes.    To solve the problem, the company turned to AI. Using AI, the system \u00e2\u0080\u009clearned\u00e2\u0080\u009d to identify component shapes after being subjected to them over hundreds or even thousands of reels. Eventually, the system \u00e2\u0080\u009clearned\u00e2\u0080\u009d to identify and classify parts by looking at the sides of the reels. With that capability, the parts counter can also compare the parts on a reel to those called out on a reel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s label. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because a reel will get a new label each time that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used.    To add AI to the parts counter, Creative Electron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineering staff needed AI programming skills. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not easy to find AI programmers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cardoso. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoogle, Amazon, and Facebook gobble them up, so we had to develop the skills in-house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   Related articles:   Is Formal Verification Artificial Intelligence?
