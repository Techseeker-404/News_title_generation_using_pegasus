Despite complex problems and short deadlines to bring extreme ultraviolet (EUV) steppers into high-volume manufacturing, experts remain upbeat. The good news is that many shoulders are pushing the wheel ahead. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the past, one company would take a lead with a new semiconductor technology, but now all the logic guys are jumping in, biting the bullet, and taking the risks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said An Steegen, executive vice president of technology and systems at Imec. The research institute in Belgium is a long-standing collaborator with ASML, the developer of EUV in the Netherlands. Together with foundries and suppliers, they now aim to work out the last major kinks in the room-sized systems that will print next-generation chips. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like when the FinFET transistor emerged in 2008 as a significant but challenging vehicle for new performance gains, said Steegen in an interview at the Imec Tech Forum here. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople compared the worst case of next node to the best case of the old node, but now all sides agree that FinFETs are extremely high-performance devices. My lesson is to take it all with a grain of salt \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there are enough features ahead to deliver improvements so that SoC designers get what they want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a separate, informal conversation waiting in line for coffee at Imec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters, a 32-year veteran working on EUV put it simply: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of pressures right now \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but we are making progress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foundry is racing to get EUV into production at 7 nm before the end of the year. It aims to pull ahead of larger rival TSMC, which is taping out many 7-nm chips now using existing immersion steppers. TSMC and GlobalFoundries are not far behind, aiming to ramp enhanced 7-nm nodes with EUV early next year. Separately, Imec estimates that DRAM makers will adopt EUV for their D14+ nodes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably in 2021, when half pitches dip below 20 nm. Two of Imec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current focus areas are helping to smooth out line-edge roughness and eliminating so-called stochastics, random errors that create missing or kissing contacts. The errors were first reported earlier this year at 15-nm dimensions key for a next-generation 5-nm node, but researchers now say that they also see them at 7 nm. Steegen expects that hybrid solutions will emerge. They will use a combination of scanner settings, resist materials, and post-processing techniques that stitch broken lines, smooth jagged ones, or fill out missing contacts. Foundries can apply higher doses of EUV light \u00e2\u0080\u0094 say, 80 millijoules/cm2  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to widen a process window, but that will slow throughput. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeciding the peak dose for the first implementations is up to the foundries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Steegen.   Engineers are addressing stochastic errors in EUV with a range of mask changes, stepper settings, resist choices, and post-processing techniques. (Images: Imec.) Click to enlarge.   "}
