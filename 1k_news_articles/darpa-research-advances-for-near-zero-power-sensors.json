That\u2019s one of the more dramatic results of DARPA\u2019s Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program, which concluded in May 2020. DARPA began the initiative in 2015 with a goal of finding ways around the lifetime limitations of IoT battery power so that sensors could be deployed in the field to detect events like vibration, light, sound, or other battlefield signals without having to be frequently replaced. (Source: DARPA) Battery lifetimes can now be extended by using sensors that only wake up to record a triggering event, such as a sound, or to periodically (instead of continuously) monitor a battlefield or other concern, said DARPA. Troops are now able to gather intelligence without having to venture into a potential combat zone themselves. They also have the reassurance that they would be moving into hazardous areas far less often to replace \u00e2\u0080\u009cbattery-dead\u00e2\u0080\u009d sensors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe N-ZERO program established asleep-yet-continuously-alert sensing capabilities for untethered, unattended systems that are triggered by specific physical or radio frequency [RF] signatures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Benjamin Griffin, program manager in DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Microsystems Technology Office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSensor lifetimes that are on the order of years will enable cost-effective and safe deployment of sensing technologies in areas lacking fixed-energy infrastructure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sensor technology improvements are ongoing, with sensor capabilities likely to expand. What Griffin acknowledged for now was that RF, acoustic, and infrared (IR) wake-up capabilities were the most successful sensing systems developed by the N-ZERO program. These near-zero-power sensors transmit radio signals to communicate (RF), measure sound levels (acoustic), and detect IR (thermal) radiation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat pleased us most was the power consumption of the best performers, which resulted in an estimated battery lifetime extension from four weeks to up to four years, based on a coin-cell battery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Griffin explained. Despite these successes, the battery lifetimes of sensors tested in the N-ZERO initiative are still limited by processing and communications of confirmed events and/or ultimately by the self-discharge of the battery itself. One move in a positive direction was the development of an ultra-low-power Arm processor. The Arm M0N0 processor achieved a 10-nW sleep power and 20- to 60-\u00c2\u00b5W/MHz active power level, depending on the application. Sensor power shutdowns allow users to store information in read-only memory (ROM) that can be accessed without the power penalty of recovering the data from off-chip non-volatile memory. Arm chips also have the capability to run for decades on one set of batteries, as their power consumption is so low. In comparison, a conventional coin-cell battery in sleep mode might have a lifetime of multiple years, but it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t operate much beyond that window. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is important because troops need to know about enemy movements and changes to the battlefield,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Griffin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, since sensors constantly consume power, they often spend time processing what turns out to be useless data. That power consumption then saps the sensors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 battery lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DARPA said that lower processing options that dramatically increase battery life (like Arm) can cut costs that get incurred when sensors must be replaced frequently because their batteries fail. Safety is also enhanced because military service personnel no longer have to physically travel to dangerous areas to replace in-field sensors that have failed and need to be replaced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn example implementation was a neural network implemented as a keyword spotter that processed audio files from the Google Speech Commands dataset at a power level that could run continuously for 200 days on an LR44 coin-cell battery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Griffin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking with DARPA, Arm has made 1,000 licenses available to the U.S. government and government contractors to allow for immediate access to processing in power-constrained environments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Solid-state sensors At the same time, solid-state sensors are beginning to appear in the defense marketplace. These sensors were not part of the original N-ZERO program, but they are being tested in the Department of Defense (DoD) applications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have worked with the DoD and with DoD subcontractors in the area of low-power sensors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jeff Sather, vice president of technology and customer solutions at Cymbet, a producer of very small solid-state batteries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to minimize sensor components and also be able to use alternative sources of battery recharging such as solar energy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we do is integrate very small solid-state batteries together with the sensors on a single chip. With solid-state batteries, you have no battery leakage and no risk of sparks or fires, but the cost of these integrated, solid-state battery, low-power sensors isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cheap. It is around $1 per sensor, when you can get a low-power coin-cell sensor that uses a traditional liquid lithium battery for around 25 cents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Price points for near-zero-power sensors integrated with solid-state battery technology are likely to come down, which could make solid-state sensors the next popular low-power sensor option, but for now, the DARPA N-ZERO program is primarily using coin-cell batteries. Memory challenges DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s N-ZERO program results are being expanded to a broader field of applications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is anticipated that N-ZERO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest use case will be within the IoT, where the power consumption of sensor nodes is one of the technical challenges to pervasive expansion of the technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Griffin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the area of agricultural and structural health monitoring, ARPA-E has continued funding under the OPEN+ Sensors for Bioenergy and Agriculture Cohort to develop sensors for plant monitoring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOther transitions of the N-ZERO technology have focused on untethered health monitoring of mechanical systems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus far, according to Griffin, the majority of successes within N-ZERO were enabled by sub-threshold circuit design. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuccessful sub-threshold approaches stored signature data in ROM or in volatile static random-access memory (SRAM) because these technologies have low-read energy requirements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe use of ROM constrains applications because the memory is set during fabrication and cannot be reprogrammed. Since SRAM is volatile, it loses memory if there is a drop in the bias voltage to the IC.\u00e2\u0080\u009d High on Griffin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cwish list\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a low-read-energy, non-volatile memory that would give untethered systems the ability to be re-programmable while simultaneously making them robust to power loss. This wish coalesces with Sather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion that the next focus of low-power sensor technology is likely to be in the area of memory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that the storage capacity on these devices will need to be increased and that there is a need for continuous improvement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.
