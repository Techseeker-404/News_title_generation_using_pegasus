In a way, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen that future, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here. Big data analysis, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles have already emerged, although not yet in perfect form. Nonetheless, most chip designers can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even imagine that brave new world, let alone the inventions that they must fashion to stay relevant. A question that haunts designers is the sheer uncertainty of the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction. As Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law nears its \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomic dead end\u00e2\u0080\u009d for most chip vendors (except giants like Intel and Samsung), is there somewhere else to turn? In July 2016, the Semiconductor Industry Association scrapped a technology plan widely known within the industry as the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). SIA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to end the ITRS illustrated the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admission that Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law is not just slowing down. The industry needs new tools, charts, and programs to define research gaps between where it has been and where to go in an even more connected world. This is where Nicky Lu, Chairman, CEO, and Founder of Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Etron Technology, comes in. Nicky Lu, CEO and Founder of Etron Technology (Photo: EE Times)  Lu has long advocated \u00e2\u0080\u009cheterogeneous integration\u00e2\u0080\u009d (HI). He promotes the idea that the semiconductor industry must, at last, outgrow its obsession with pitch shrinkage. To push growth, it must go creative with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cheterogeneous integration of different technologies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By HI, he does not mean homogeneously integrated SoCs, Systems-in-Package (SiPs), or Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs). Lu views HI as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca holistically integrated approach\u00e2\u0080\u009d that involves system design, algorithms, and software, together with different types of silicon dice such as SoC, DRAM, flashes, A-to-D/D-to-A, power management, security, and reliability control dices. Thus far, the chip industry has made great progress in SiP. However, Lu told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow in 2018, I am seeing [the need for] even more sophisticated HI that actually integrates not only silicon dice but also non-silicon materials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Three IEEE societies behind HI  The groundwork to develop a Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap (HIR) began in 2015, when the SIA and one of the IEEE Societies signed an MOU, according to Bill Bottoms, chairman of Third Millennium Test Solutions (3MTS). Bottoms is a co-chair of HIR, along William Chen, ASE Fellow at ASE Group. By 2016, HIR got official sponsorships from three IEEE Societies: the IEEE Electronics Packaging Society (EPS), IEEE Electronic Devices Society (EDS), and IEEE Photonics Society. Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Electronic and Photonic Packaging Division (EPPD) also signed up to work on HIR. The wheels really started to churn last year. As the HIR group held workshops throughout the world to evangelize its mission, \u00e2\u0080\u009cclose to 1,000 scientists, researchers, and senior engineers showed up and pledged to participate in HIR,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bottoms. When it comes to its membership, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are keeping the quality of standards very high,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stressed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are picking only those with technical credentials and real commitment to contribute to each technical working group.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Typical marketing onlookers who just want to suck up information aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t included, explained Bottoms. Bottoms defines the scope of the HIR as \u00e2\u0080\u009cidentification of the difficult challenges we need to overcome in meeting technical requirements for the next 15 years and 25 years for emerging research areas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The group is developing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-competitive\u00e2\u0080\u009d roadmap, he noted. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far more efficient in pooling industry resources to chart the future instead of fragmenting efforts and diverging into too many directions. The HIR group sees the primary integration technology for potential solutions as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplex SiP architectures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In many ways, Bottoms said that the industry has begun to see products in which silicon dice and non-silicon materials are together in one package. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne good example of HI is Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photonics optical transceivers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted, in which Intel applied silicon wafer planar manufacturing technology to the volume manufacture of electro-optical transceivers. Another example is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cS2,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the second-generation SiP in the Apple Watch 2. Just like S1, these SiP modules mix package styles in one module. The module contains components that can be packaged as bare-die (CSP, WLP, etc.) or traditional wire-bonded packages, or even multi-chip configurations like package-on-package or a multi-die memory DRAM or NAND. \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple has pushed the SiP concept so far out into the future \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a road nobody has taken before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bottoms. TechInsights, in its Apple Watch 2 teardown, wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe S2 contains more than 42 die! That is a lot of silicon in such a small module.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Similarly, Bottoms was marveled at the 98 interconnects inside S2. Nothing pleases Lu more than the growing momentum behind HI. Heterogeneous integration is no longer just his passion, but is spreading throughout electronics, Lu told us. Earlier this year, Lu gave a plenary talk entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cSynergistic Growth of AI and Silicon Age 4.0 through Heterogeneous Integration of Technologies\u00e2\u0080\u009d at an IEEE-organized event in Santa Clara. He told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo many people came to see me after my speech. They were all so excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so exciting? Lu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about the nuts and bolts of integrating heterogeneously. Instead, he described his focus as broadening the scope of research and development in the semiconductor industry. Now that the chip industry is no longer hostage to continuous scaling, Lu believes that it can apply its knowledge to a larger mission. The next step, he says, is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpervasive intelligence\u00e2\u0080\u009d enabled across different industries ranging from AI, human, and natural interface to bio, cells, bacteria, and medical intelligence. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing to discuss best designs for next-generation AI chips. Everyone does. But if the industry wants a \u00e2\u0080\u009croadmap\u00e2\u0080\u009d to extend forward 25 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better start making intelligence pervasive, explained Lu. Obsession  Before describing what Lu defines as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpervasive intelligence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to understand how Lu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in heterogeneous integration has evolved. Born and educated in Taiwan, Lu earned his M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. At the IBM Research Div., where he started his career, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known as a co-inventor of a 3D-DRAM technology and a designer of High-Speed CMOS DRAM (HSDRAM). Over several decades, this technical virtuosity, abetted by an infectious smile and passionate demeanor, have made Lu a vocal force within the semiconductor industry. Lu has advocated Heterogeneous Integration ever since delivering a plenary talk at the 2004 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC). He pointed out that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfuture system chips will fully utilize multi-dimensional integration, within a single package, of multiple dies that cover a variety of digital, analog, memory, and RF functions and technologies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prediction of an emerging era of 3D ICs was considered bold then. He wanted to demonstrate what could be accomplished by the vertical integration of dice at a time when the chip world was largely content to follow Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whose sole precept is the constant scaling of transistors. Advancement in packaging  Fast forward to 2018, when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to argue that the era of the SiP is already here and the death of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law is greatly exaggerated. The packaging technology that the chip industry knew in 2004 has made remarkable strides. Consider the integrated fan-out (InFO) wafer-level packaging technology achieved by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s InFO enabled Apple to offer a very thin package-on-package, with a high number of I/O pads and better thermal management for the A10 applications processor in the iPhone 7. "}
