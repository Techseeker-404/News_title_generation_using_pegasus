Each protocol has its own set of unique characteristics and advantages, depending on use cases and application requirements. Developers need to understand how each protocol performs in the key areas of power consumption, throughput, latency, scalability and security. Silicon Labs recently released the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first performance benchmark results for Zigbee, Thread and Bluetooth mesh. It compares how each protocol performs in different test conditions and network configurations. We conducted the tests over a 12-month period in a commercial Boston office building with active Wi-Fi and Zigbee networks in range. The wireless test clusters were deployed in hallways, meeting rooms, offices and open areas. Key takeaways include:  Thread, Zigbee and Bluetooth mesh perform similarly in small networks under small payloads. Thread and Zigbee outperform Bluetooth mesh when payload and throughput needs increase. Bluetooth mesh performance can improve after installation if the installer manually optimizes the network by disabling some routing nodes. Latency increases for all three protocols as network size grows, but Bluetooth mesh experiences the largest increase. For large Bluetooth mesh networks, relay optimization can be used to optimize performance. Bluetooth mesh works best when short messages (of 11 bytes or less) are used, especially for multicast messages.  The fact is, there is no winning mesh protocol. Performance varies greatly based on the application requirements. The test results underscored several factors that are critical in making the right protocol choice. The choice of ecosystems, for example, has a profound impact on protocol performance. If a device manufacturer wants to interoperate with established ecosystems such as Amazon Echo Plus, Philips Hue or Comcast Xfinity, Zigbee is an optimal choice. The use case also played a pivotal role in the performance results. For example, the ability to turn on lights simultaneously in a warehouse may be less important than the lighting systems\u00e2\u0080\u0099 power consumption or the ability to add more services to the network. Power consumption should not be overlooked when assessing protocols. Home and building automation applications often use a combination of battery-powered, line-powered and even energy harvesting devices, often presenting very different use cases for mesh protocols. You can review the benchmark results in greater detail here. The results also are available as a series of application notes that explain the methodology for performing the benchmark tests, enabling developers to replicate and run similar tests. Overall, the mesh performance study concluded that network size, required latency, desired throughput and reliability are key factors in selecting the appropriate protocol. The variety of factors and protocols may make it seem daunting to choose, but if the designer has a clear understanding of the use case, the ideal mesh protocol for the application will emerge. \u2013Tom Pannell is the senior director of marketing for Silicon Labs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Internet of Things products.
