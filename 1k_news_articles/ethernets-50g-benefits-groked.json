At the same time, it has broken from its traditional 10x speed increases to meet the needs of large and diverse markets, leading to instances where 10M and 400G projects existed at the same time. To the uninitiated, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much new in a new, \u00e2\u0080\u009cslower\u00e2\u0080\u009d 50G standard. If you are simply looking at how many bits you can send from one point to another, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much difference in overall throughput between the old 100G (4x25G) and the new 100G (2x50G). The IEEE 802.3cd project was the first project to define a 50G and 200G MAC rate. Before that, two 25G devices would need to be connected to get 50G. Now, a developer can take that 50G MAC and scale it to a x2 (100G) or x4 (200G) and ultimately meet or exceed existing 100G technology using less real estate. We are also seeing new MSAs coming online that leverage the capabilities of QSFP-DD to connect at a 50\u00d78 (400G) rate over copper cabling, the same channels used for existing 25G links. This cuts down the cost dramatically when compared to optics. The form factor allows it to fit into a normal QSFP28 slot or fully use the double density lanes with the additional QSFP28 cable that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hidden below the vintage one everyone is used to. The 50G technology is impressive because of that last detail\u2013it can work over direct attach cables. Another big change for 50G is the signaling scheme which uses PAM4 instead of the classic NRZ, allowing four possible levels instead of two that can be transmitted. Partnered Content: Learn How integrated cloud-to-edge services accelerate IoT solution development The PAM4 choice allows for twice the amount of symbols to be sent at the same speed. The 50G signal is actually being sent at about 26Gbaud on account of the error correction overhead which cuts it down to 25G. The 50G spec still supports 100G NRZ (4x25G) because it offers a seamless transition from 10G using the QSFP form factor. Naturally, 200G would be the next step in cases where 50G is not immediately adopted. The ability to use 50G of throughput in conjunction with PCIe Gen5 will allow NICs to make best use of the bandwidth. And the ability to scale 50G to a x4 or even possibly a x8 configuration allows for the highest density for switches currently available. There are some tradeoffs to using this signaling scheme and some caveats about the current ecosystem. In packing four levels into the same amplitude swing of two in NRZ you lose almost 10 dB of signal-to-noise ratio. This puts a heavy burden on the receiver to undo all the channel loss and jitter from the transmitter. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a closed-eye specification, so if you were to look at the output before the receiver, it would be a big wall of fuzzy noise. Engineers have managed to squeak out every ounce of bandwidth through the same channels that have been discussed since the early stages of the 40/100G project. Just like 10G with 100G, 40/100G will still have its use cases long after the arrival of 50/100/200/400G. But the early adopters who are already using 50G serial links will see the greatest density in terms of aggregate bandwidth on a single switch, and most are likely already onto the next chapter of Ethernet\u2013100G serial. \u2013Michael Klempa is the Ethernet and storage technical manager covering SAS, SATA, PCIe, and Ethernet testing services at the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory.
