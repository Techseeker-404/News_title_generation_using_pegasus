Although little known in the United States, C-Sky (C stands for \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina\u00e2\u0080\u009d), founded in Hangzhou in 2001, had already shipped 500 million of its embedded CPUs by the end of last year. The cores have found a home in a variety of embedded systems \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0ranging from set-top boxes to IC cards and printers, according to Xiaoning Qi, CEO of C-Sky. C-Sky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core business is designing a 32-bit high-performance and low-power embedded CPU, then licensing the chip architecture. Since 2003, when it rolled out its first CPU core called CK510, C-Sky has been quietly developing a host of embedded cores, SoC platforms, software tools and middleware.\u00c2\u00a0The company, now offering seven cores, has picked 70 licensees so far in China. Qi, attending at the Design Automation Conference here this week, sat down with EE Times for an exclusive interview.  Currently, the global embedded market appears already spoken for by much more formidable and dominant CPU processing cores such as ARM and MIPS. So why bother developing yet another CPU core? Qi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s straightforward answers reflected a Chinese optimism that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never too late to innovate \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0especially if the result is designed by China, made in China and nurtured for China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina needs to work on the development of \u00e2\u0080\u0098core technologies,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and we think our embedded CPU is one of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Qi.\u00c2\u00a0 Qi acknowledged that C-Sky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ecosystem and tools aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly as exhaustive or well established as ARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a downside,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\u00a0 But 50 percent of C-Sky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team is software engineers, who \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinue to focus on developing design chains and simulators.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The upside is that C-Sky can compete not just in cost, but with \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood support\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0providing a lot more hand-holding for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nascent embedded systems designers, Qi explained. Compared to its competitors, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are a lot more flexible in meeting our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ace in the hole C-Sky\u2019s ace in the hole might be its unique tie with Alibaba Corp., headed up by Jack Ma \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0one of three Chinese Internet behemoths often lumped together as \u00e2\u0080\u009cBAT\u00e2\u0080\u009d companies, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. \u00c2\u00a0 It turns out that C-Sky is the first chip company in the world to receive a sizable investment from Alibaba. Attention from an Internet giant like Alibaba isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just unusual. For any chip hardware startup struggling to get funded, this sort of investment is pennies from Heaven.\u00c2\u00a0 Although Qi declined to disclose the amount provided by Ma, he revealed that he and his mentor, Prof. Xiaolang Yan, C-Sky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s founder and chairman, have lobbied Alibaba to acknowledge that hardware technology is critical to the future of the e-commerce giant.\u00c2\u00a0 Next page: Taiwan\u2019s Andes Technology      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
