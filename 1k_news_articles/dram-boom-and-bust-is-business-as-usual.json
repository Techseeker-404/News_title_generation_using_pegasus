It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long been the cycle for established memory technologies. As 3D NAND pricing softens, DRAM still appears to be going strong. But for how long? And will these ups and downs always be the norm despite diversified demand and emerging vendors from China? One key characteristic of the DRAM market is that there are currently only three major suppliers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Micron Technology, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re keeping a pretty tight rein on their capacity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brian Matas, vice president of market research at IC Insights, said in a telephone interview with EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd at the same time, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also pretty strong demand for higher performance and higher-density parts, particularly from the data center and server applications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Partnered Content: Learn how to simplify FPGA reference clocking with Silicon Labs timing solutions] In a sense, smartphones and tablets are the new PCs, which used to be the main driver of the DRAM industry. Matas said that the new purchase cycle on smartphones is widening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven though smartphones are improving and more DRAM is being added, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re maybe not seeing the extensive or the explosive annual growth rate or increase in unit shipment from smartphones that we saw initially,\u201d Matas said.\u00c2\u00a0 Big DRAM buyers are companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, who are going ahead and buying whatever memory they need to run large, network storage systems and server applications, said Matas, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fine with paying a premium price because of limited DRAM capacity. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an increase in DRAM content in smartphones, he said, as well as a big increase in automotive. This diversified demand for DRAM is one reason why Micron sees the market as being fundamentally different than in previous years, said Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief business officer at Micron, in a telephone interview. Sadana also point to the consolidation of vendors in recent years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe the industry going forward is going to be a lot more stable than it has ever been in the past, and that is a function of the consolidation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Sadana said. He added that Micron is being more thoughtful and cautious about capacity expansion and staying in sync with the demand trends and its customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 requirements. Sadana echoes Matas when it comes to diverse places for DRAM to go today \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no longer is two-thirds of the demand driven by the PC business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe market is now dominated by bigger segments like mobile and much faster-growing segments like cloud and autonomous driving applications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Sadana said, as well as high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. This year is expected to be the most profitable year in history for the industry, and Micron expects a robust industry environment over the next five to 10 years.    IC Insight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brian Matas says that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to understand why a downturn for DRAM ASP is in its near-term forecast given all the money being dedicated to DRAM capex last year and this year.   Sadana attributes this healthy outlook to the fact that many innovative trends such as AI, machine learning and autonomous driving are still very much in their infancy, with the latter transforming the car into a computer that requires massive amounts of DRAM. Meanwhile, he said that the servers going into data centers to run cloud-computing workloads are two-thirds DRAM and flash, and they are the heart of all processing for AI and machine learning. Other drivers of demand include the internet of things, augmented and virtual reality, and cryptocurrency. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a bad thing when DRAM prices drop as long as the costs of making it drop are in parallel, said Sadana. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only when prices fall much faster than cost and on a sustained basis that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause for concern. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reality is that the industry has been growing over the last several decades and the pricing has been continuously coming down over this time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo long as price declines keep pace with cost declines that are current with the inevitable march of technology, it can certainly create ongoing healthy conditions for the semiconductor players. Falling prices in and of themselves are not any indication of the health of the market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s optimism about longer-term profitability, investment analysts are already revising their outlooks for the company and the industry at large, with one Goldman Sachs analyst citing \u00e2\u0080\u009cincremental weakness in both DRAM and NAND fundamentals per our discussions with industry contacts and also based on our supply/demand analysis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matas said that IC Insights is seeing a softening of average selling prices in the DRAM market. They will likely start plateauing through the end of the year and then start to decline as some of this capacity begins to come online and ramps up, leading to bigger tumbles in price by 2020. He does expect that these cycles will continue, although the amplitude of the growth was surprising as were the extreme peaks and valleys in part because there are only three players. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the prices rising so much and with the investments becoming so tremendous, it becomes difficult for any of them to outspend the other in such a way that they can gain more market share, and nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to flood the market with excess capacity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Matas said.\u00c2\u00a0 "}
