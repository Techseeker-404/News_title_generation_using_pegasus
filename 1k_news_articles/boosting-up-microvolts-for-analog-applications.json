However, a digital sensor \u00e2\u0080\u008e gives binary output in the form of ones and zeroes. But, if you want precise output, analog sensors are the best choice. To convert an analog voltage to digital form ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) is used. Some sensors output in the form of millivolts and microvolts. However, it would be a tedious task for an ADC in a microcontroller to read micro volts from an analog sensor. This article is a quick guide to building a simple microvolts booster circuit capable of converting few microvolts to millivolts. At the heart of this circuit is an ultra-low offset voltage dual op-amp AD708 that provides splendid dc precision with utmost offset voltage and drift. This operational amplifier is a perfect for analog sensor applications offering 5V/\u00c2\u00b5V with a drift of 0.1 \u00c2\u00b5V/ \u00c2\u00b0C. Pin Configuration    The AD708 uses two operational amplifiers A and B. You can connect two analog transducers to the same IC (integrated circuit). This feasibility makes AD708 op-amp suitable for building high gain instrumentation amplifiers. The IC is powered up using one positive supply and negative supply. The AD708 acts as a differential op-amp. \u00c2\u00a0This amplifier boosts the changes between the two inputs \u00e2\u0080\u0093IN A (inverting input) and +IN A (non-inverting input) and captures the common voltage between the two inputs. The output voltage is present at OUTPUT A and OUTPUT B.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Warning! \u00c2\u00a0This IC is very sensitive in nature. The op-amp is power with ESD (electrostatic discharge) circuitry. But still, in some cases, it may damage the functionality or degrade the performance. Hence, it is recommended to maintain proper ESD precautions. Microvolt to Millivolt Converter\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0  Here is the schematic of microvolt to millivolt circuit. The analog input can be connected to VIN (Input voltage). The analog input may be of your choice. I have \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0tested with an analog sensor. Opamp A  Opamp B  The operational amplifier works in the range of \u00c2\u00b13V to \u00c2\u00b115V. Two coupling capacitors are added for blocking DC. The gain of the circuit is 100. A challenging task I have encountered in experimenting with this circuit is that it requires a negative voltage power supply to function. After some serious thoughts, to work out the prototype I have used a regulated power supply (RPS) and 9V battery for the initial test setup. I have connected the VIN to a 9V battery positive lead and negative pin to ground. Similarly, to force apply negative voltage I have connected the positive lead of the RPS to the ground and negative lead to the 4th pin of op-amp i.e. -VS. A potentiometer can be used for varying the voltage at the input pin (6). Finally, here is the tested circuit. It is a mix up of SMD resistors and jumpers.   Betterments  The output of the above circuit can be improved further by increasing the gain factor using another operational amplifier LM224. As I said, the AD708 op-amp operates in the range of \u00c2\u00b13V to \u00c2\u00b115V, to generate a negative voltage you can use a MAX3232 driver/receiver which is commonly used in RS232 communication. The output of max232 6th pin is -5 volts. This can be fed to AD708 op-amp negative pin (4).\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 Another way to generate a negative voltage is to use a LM337 regulator. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?  There are number of solutions for making a simple microvolts to millivolts converter circuit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you only have to take a thought to do that. The output is ideal for lower input voltages but may be affected by UHF frequencies in the range of gigahertz.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Share your ideas too and join the fun.
