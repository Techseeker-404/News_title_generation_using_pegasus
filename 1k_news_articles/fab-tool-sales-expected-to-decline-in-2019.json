In its year-end forecast, released on Wednesday (Dec. 12) at the Semicon Japan trade show, SEMI estimated that fab tool sales will grow 9.7% this year to reach a record $62.1 billion. The forecast is consistent with other forecasts released earlier this year, despite slowing sales growth in recent months. But the forecast calls for tool sales to decline to $56.6 billion next year before rebounding to grow 20.7% in 2020, reaching a new record high of $71.9 billion. SEMI projects that the market for wafer processing equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the largest category of semiconductor production equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will grow 10.2% this year to reach $50.2 billion. The chip test equipment market is expected to grow by 15.6% this year to reach $5.4 billion, while the assembly and packaging equipment market is forecast to grow 1.9% to reach $4 billion, said SEMI.
