Amid the crises, chips are taking center stage in what looks like a new, pandemic-driven industrial policy . Manufacturing advanced and secure circuits domestically is no longer just a talking point. Momentum is building, observers note. The Creating Helpful Incentives for Producing Semiconductors in America Act (CHIPS Act) is wending its way through the congressional budget process. Politicians, bureaucrats and semiconductor companies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including Intel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increasingly back efforts to beef up chip production on US soil. With \u201creal money\u201d likely available by the fall, the domestic chip industry is scurrying for a piece of the action. A key question remains: Whether the bill offers substantive funds, or is just \u00e2\u0080\u009canother paper tiger\u00e2\u0080\u009d? says Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research. More important, will the U.S. government stick to this new industrial policy for the long term? With Congress in its August recess, EE Times offers the primer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who, what and how of the CHIPS Act. We also examine why \u00c2\u00a0both the US government and semiconductor industry are in the midst of a 180-degree reversal of the globalization drumbeat they have followed for decades. We spoke with James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and VLSI Research\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO Hutcheson. Dan Hutcheson Are we living in the post-globalization era? When Hutcheson said during the recent SIA webinar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe live in the post-globalization era,\u00e2\u0080\u009d everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears perked up. A post-globalization era almost sounds like the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpost-truth era\u00e2\u0080\u009d hailed by Kellyanne Conway, counselor to U.S. president Donald Trump early in 2016. But what does \u00e2\u0080\u009cpost-globalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d really mean? Hutcheson believes an era has begun in which \u00e2\u0080\u009call countries are beginning to wall themselves off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0Attention has shifted from the global economy to national security concerns. Hutcheson said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen anything like this since the mid-eighties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Can you build semiconductors without having anything come across the borders? No, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Hutcheson. The chip industry has been globalizing for the last 50 years, largely because different regions in the world have shown different areas of excellence. Hutcheson explained that Japan, for example, excelled in lithography and resist processing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had materials coming out of Japan that are just the best in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Europeans spent heavily to compete, and built their own vertical silos in the 1980s, explained Hutcheson. \u00c2\u00a0ASML was born, today among the few vendors offering advanced EUV tools. Then, what makes the idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpost-globalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d even remotely attractive? First is the technology cold war between China and the United States, which is the new reality. Second, as Chinese wages keep rising, China has lost its cost competitiveness. The U.S. appetite and China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss of cost advantages are reinforcing the perception that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for the US government and chip industry to reassert themselves. Ultimately, Hutcheson forecasts the potential for \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-end manufacturing starting to pop back in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the CHIPS For America Act? Section 1091: Incentive grants not to exceed $3 billion for any chip manufacturing project. Grants would be dispersed by the Commerce Department for projects focused on chip assembly, testing, packaging, fabrication and R&D. Section 1092: Defense Department industrial partnerships to advanced secure microelectronics for use by the U.S. government and to build secure supply chains. The provision requires DoD planners to report progress to Congress on both fronts. Section 1093: Requires a Commerce Department study on the status of microelectronics technology and the defense industrial base. A relatively short timeframe of 120 days is specified to submit the status report. Section 1094: Funding to develop \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeasurably\u00e2\u0080\u009d secure microelectronics, including a multilateral secure microelectronics fund to allow the U.S. to work with allies and partners to forge a standard approach to secure microelectronics. Section 1095: Funds advanced semiconductor R&D overseen by the National Science and Technology Council. Also directs the Secretary of Commerce to work with the Manufacturing Institute to conduct research and promote workforce training. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only caveat is the companies that use this money have to make sure the intellectual property remains controlled by the U.S.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what survives [the House-Senate] conference, but I think most of these will make it through.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Recommended  EE Times on Air: Seismology 1: Nvidia & Arm | Seismology 2: US IC Manufacturing on the Rebound   What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in it for domestic chip makers? Given the recent U.S. courting of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) by state and federal officials, Lewis says domestic chip makers are looking for equal treatment when it comes to tax breaks and other incentives. Loss of access to the Chinese market via strict new export controls, a potential blow to North American IC equipment vendors, will reduce their ability to invest in R&D. Hence, the argument goes, equipment and EDA vendors will require tax incentives to prop up capex spending. As U.S. export controls begin to bite, compensating IC vendors via CHIPS Act provisions could soften the blow, Lewis says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis bill uses both incentives, subsidies, tax breaks, but also tax credits. Think of it as next-generation [U.S.] industrial policy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d James Lewis Where does Intel fit in? Despite recent setbacks, Intel remains the leader of the chip pack, dominating key markets like servers. Few rivals can match its R&D and capex spending. Still, Intel would not be where it is today without substantial U.S. military and aerospace funding in the 1950s and 1960s. We are in a similar situation today, and the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest chip maker understands the stakes. Will Intel emerge as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnational champion\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a technological cold war with China? Probably not, since fabs are dispersed around the world. Hence, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely Intel becomes America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer to TSMC. Others wait in the wings, including GlobalFoundries and agile U.S.-owned partner SkyWater. Those capabilities offer the possibility of ramping up chip manufacturing skills in areas like packaging, test and assembly. After four decades of outsourcing, those capabilities are seen as the best way for western chip makers to move up the production learning curve. Ultimately, those manufacturing skills could prove as strategic as 7nm, 5nm and finer chip geometries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe focus here is not on making any one American company the champion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lewis of CSIS says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut in making sure TSMC isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t selling to a potential enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, Beijing is investing heavily in Shanghai-based SMIC, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., as its national champion. SMIC represents Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hedge should it be cut off from access to TSMC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading-edge manufacturing technology. Lewis suggests the U.S. strategy includes a combination of huge investments, export controls and other sanctions to maintain and extend western chip dominance. Will Intel go for becoming a \u00e2\u0080\u0098trusted fab\u00e2\u0080\u0099? Just like Lewis, Hutcheson agrees that Intel will not likely try to become the next TSMC. The custom foundry business requires a very different culture and manufacturing base to serve its customers. However, he pointed out that Intel could carve off some of its fab capacity for making defense products. Intel today, however, is not designated as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrusted fab\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the DoD. While defense doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require a lot of capacity, it would be a mistake to think any smallish fab could do the job. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Hutcheson said that defense customers demand that fabs have \u00e2\u0080\u009con-going volume manufacturing\u00e2\u0080\u009d capability to make products at the extreme edge. Defense-qualified fabs \u00e2\u0080\u009cneed to roll a lot of wafers to actually get high-quality parts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hutcheson, \u201clike stuff used in things like iPhones.\u201d Consider the VHSIC (Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits) launched by the US Department of Defense in 1980. This government program met challenges, and hard lessons were learned, according to Hutcheson. The VHSIC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal was to lead advances in IC materials, lithography, packaging, testing and algorithms. Initially, this was planned as a small-scale fab to advance defense manufacturing, budgeted with $20 million. Hutcheson said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI kept pointing out then, no, you need billions of dollars, not millions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0The VHSIC program ended up spending more than $1 billion for silicon integrated circuit technology development. Today, the good news is the availability of leading fabs in the United States, including GlobalFoundries and SkyWater. TSMC (if it keeps a promise to come to Arizona) and Intel, once designated as a trusted fab, could join the parade. What lit the fire under Congress? Beijing laid down the gauntlet with its aspirational technology roadmap, Made in China 2025, that seeks to move slowly by steadily up the semiconductor food chain over the next half decade. Dominating the global chip industry is among several high-tech goals, and China is pouring billions into its chip strategy. Whether it can deliver remains to be seen. Either way, U.S. policy makers are looking over their shoulders, waiting to see if Chinese chip makers can duplicate early successes in AI and aerospace. One thing is certain: Beijing is committing billions to silicon R&D, underscoring the strategic importance of electronics in a technology cold war centered on semiconductors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sense that the American leadership is threatened by these huge Chinese investments accompanied by predatory pricing and espionage and the usual bag of tricks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Lewis. The current legislative push is likely to be followed by other substantive measures, he predicts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a huge shift in how [lawmakers] make policy, and the U.S. is now willing to spend a lot more money than it was willing to spend before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Has the U.S. chip industry reached its \u00e2\u0080\u009cSputnik moment\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Probably. For decades, industrial policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094derisively referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpicking winners and losers\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been politically \u00e2\u0080\u009cradioactive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing technology prowess and deep pockets changed all that\u00e2\u0080\u0094while also providing an external threat that politicians often find useful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone now realizes that semiconductors are a strategic industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lewis notes. Hence, according to chief Senate Democratic sponsor Mark Warner of Virginia, the CHIPS Act contains \u00e2\u0080\u009creal money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warner, a former cell phone industry entrepreneur and vice-chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is perhaps best situated to gauge the threat posed by China. Hence, funding will be spread among key government agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DoD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial base office, Commerce Department and the National Science Foundation. Along with rebuilding the U.S. chip industry after decades of outsourcing, lawmakers also want to begin the process of \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-shoring\u00e2\u0080\u009d chip manufacturing capacity and rebuilding fab capabilities. Given the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global nature, Lewis is not sold on re-shoring as a U.S. industrial policy objective. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to think of this as moving fabs out of China, ending our [supply chain] dependency on China.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic account in large measure for this seismic shift in U.S. industrial policy, undoubtedly a lasting legacy of our present scourge. Is manufacturing coming back? No, the US won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be assembling iPhones in America. But for high-end manufacturing such as semiconductors, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cquite possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hutcheson noted. Accelerating such a move are rising geopolitical concerns. Think military threats by China, highlighted by its claims in and around the South China Sea. During the last century, the US government kept the machine tool industry alive as a hedge for weapons manufacturing. The same principle might well apply to the semiconductor industry, the backbone of modern society and technology warfare. \u00c2\u00a0 Tune into the latest episode of EE Times on Air Weekly Briefing. Amid a pandemic, a trade war, and supply-chain disruption, US politicians are working on legislation to encourage more domestic semiconductor tech development \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with Dan Hutcheson (VLSI Research), James Lewis (Center for Strategic and International Studies), and Jeff Rittener (Intel). \u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
