Graphcore\u2019s series C funding, provided by venture firm Sequoia Capital, will be used to scale up production of the startup\u2019s first chip, which it calls an Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU). Graphcore plans to make the IPU available to early access customers at the beginning of next year. In addition to scaling up production, the new funding will be used to help build a community of developers around Graphcore\u2019s Poplar software platform, driving the company\u2019s extended product roadmap and investing in its Palo Alto, Calif.-based U.S. team to help support customers, Graphcore (Bristol, U.K.) said.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u201cEfficient AI processing power is rapidly becoming the most sought-after resource in the technological world,\u201d said Nigel Toon, Graphcore\u2019s CEO, in a press statement. \u201cWe believe our IPU technology will become the worldwide standard for machine intelligence compute.\u201d Graphcore, which is featured in the most recent edition of EE Times Silicon 60, is perhaps the furthest along of a crop of startups that have been formed to create new processor architectures for deep neural networks (DNNs). In addition to Graphcore, other well-funded startups include Wave Computing, Cerebras and Groq. These startups and others are in the early days of battle with the likes of more established companies such as Google, which has offered its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) custom ASIC for machine learning since last year, Nvidia GPUs and Intel, which acquired Nervana and plans to sample its Neural Network Processor ASSP next year.  Toon maintains that the performance of Graphcore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s processor \u201cis going to be transformative\u201d compared to other accelerators. The company last month shared preliminary benchmarks that it says demonstrate that the IPU can improve performance of machine intelligence training and inference workloads by 10-100 times compared with current hardware. Previous investors in Graphcore include both Samsung Catalyst Fund, the venture capital arm of Samsung, and Robert Bosch Venture Capital. Matt Miller, a partner at Sequoia, will join Graphcore\u2019s board of directors as the result of the funding, the company said. Bill Coughran, another partner at Sequoia, will join Graphcore\u2019s technical advisory board, the company said. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
