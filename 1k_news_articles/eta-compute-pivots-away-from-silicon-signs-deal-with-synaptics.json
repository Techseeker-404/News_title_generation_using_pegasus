The startup has also announced a strategic partnership with Synaptics, wherein Synaptics has invested in Eta Compute and will exclusively license the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tensai Flow software. Moving forward, Eta Compute will continue to sell its existing ECM3532 ultra-low power AI chip, though there will be no further generations of Eta Compute silicon. The company will also develop boards and modules based on both the ECM3532 and Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 new Katana AI SoC. Eta Compute also announced it has closed a series C round of funding, raising $12.5 million, bringing the total funds raised to $31.5 million. The round was led by Synaptics, along with participation from existing investors. Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chief strategy officer, Satish Ganesan has joined the Eta Compute board of directors. Eta Compute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ECM3532 is a heterogeneous multi-core SoC optimized for ultra-low power AIoT applications which can perform AI inference with only microwatts of energy. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secret sauce is in a proprietary voltage and frequency scaling technique achieved without a phase locked loop (PLL), combined with Arm Cortex-M3 and NXP CoolFlux DSP cores which both operate voltage and frequency scaling independently. Either or both cores can be used to accelerate the AI workload. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software stack, Tensai Flow, includes both a compiler for the ECM3532 and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodel zoo\u00e2\u0080\u009d of neural network models optimized for low-power operation. Edge intelligence Synaptics has been diversifying its portfolio into the IoT space, acquiring Broadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wireless IoT business this summer (alongside docking station IC and software company DisplayLink). Satish Ganesan, chief strategy officer at Synaptics told EE Times that the company is shipping SoCs into products like smart speakers, set top boxes, smart displays and headsets, where the trend is towards more intelligence at the edge. AI inference on battery power is quite a challenge; Synaptics has launched a platform for this market called Katana. The platform includes an AI-capable multi-core SoC optimized for low power consumption in edge devices, and will now also include Eta Compute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tensai Flow software. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe intent is to add a family of processors as the market expands, because the scope of the market is pretty wide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ganesan said. The first SoC in Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Katana family is an AI-capable multi-core design (Image: Synaptics) Like Eta Compute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ECM3532, the Katana SoC uses a hybrid multi-core architecture (in this case, a standard Arm core and a custom DSP optimized for low power), but Katana offers a higher performance option that is sufficient to run more than one kind of AI inference in parallel. While there may be some architectural similarities with the ECM3532, the design is Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Why not just acquire Eta Compute and bring the team and software in-house? \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn investment was the right vehicle for us at this moment in time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ganesan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019ll explore the market together and determine future steps at a later time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The two companies plan to go to market together. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEta Compute will have access to our Katana silicon to be able to develop modules, boards and platforms, depending on the customers, to go and tackle the market from their perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ganesan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor certain customers or certain applications, we\u2019ll be able to pair up with the Eta Compute software and compiler and provide that as a bundle to our customers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u2019s a joint development and joint promotion deal that we have reached.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Energy efficiency Following the launch of Eta Compute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ECM3532, customers said their top priority other than energy efficiency was ease of use, Ted Tewksbury, CEO of Eta Compute told EE Times. This is especially true of heterogeneous processing architectures which can be challenging to program. Ted Tewksbury (Image: Eta Compute) \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we heard from the market very clearly is that you need a very easy to use, push button approach to interface these complex processors with TensorFlow, PyTorch and other AI frameworks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tewksbury said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re working very closely with Synaptics to do co-optimization of the hardware and software to provide the most efficient code on the Synaptics Katana processor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tewskbury said that Tensai Flow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compiler can get an order of magnitude better energy efficiency than other compilers on the market, or proprietary ones. This is done through a variety of memory optimization techniques, as well as performance and energy optimization, but the software must be optimized for the specific target processor. Tensai Flow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compiler, originally optimized for the ECM3532, will be ported over to the Katana processor. Synaptics is an exclusive licensee \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the compiler will not be optimized for other target hardware. Given the heterogeneous multi-core (Arm microcontroller plus DSP) nature of both chips, there is a lot of synergy between TensaiFlow and Katana, Tewksbury said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the reasons for this partnership, our software is unique in the industry in being able to translate and compress and optimize from TensorFlow to hybrid multi-core processors, which are the most difficult to do embedded programming on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tewksbury said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs we looked across the industry, Synaptics with Katana really had the most advanced, most sophisticated and most energy efficient hybrid multi-core processor out there. And so there\u2019s a lot of synergy, because we\u2019ve already developed those techniques for optimizing and compiling from TensorFlow to a hybrid multi-core architecture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eta Compute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TensaiFlow toolchain (Image: Eta Compute) Business model While Eta Compute has licensed its software to Synaptics, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new business model is not software licensing. Instead the company will focus on more of an end-to-end solution, designing modules around its own, and Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099, silicon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt this time we don\u2019t plan to do any further Silicon development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tewksbury said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe plan to rely on Synaptics for Katana, for the current generation, and then work co-operatively towards next generation products,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tewksbury said. Eta Compute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI-enabled sensor node board (Image: Eta Compute) Ditching silicon development will help Eta Compute to reduce its overheads. Going forward, Tewksbury plans to grow the company by building sales of the existing ECM3532, along with boards and modules based on the ECM3532 and Katana which use the Tensai Flow software. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEventually, we will wrap additional application software, whether it\u2019s dashboards, analytics, business insights as a service, we\u2019ll wrap those services around our modular solutions and sell those as complete solutions to the customer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tewksbury said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat gives us an order of magnitude or more increase in our [average selling price]. So we\u2019ve essentially pivoted from being a pure play semiconductor company to being a system solutions company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The first member of the Katana SoC family is available now, as is Eta Compute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ECM3532. A version of Eta Compute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tensai Flow software tailored for Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Katana hardware will be available in the first half of 2021.
