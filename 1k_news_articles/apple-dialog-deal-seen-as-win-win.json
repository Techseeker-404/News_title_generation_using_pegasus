But by late last year, Dialog could see the writing on the wall, warning in a regulatory filing that it realized that Apple had the potential to bring its PMIC development in house, leaving Dialog out in the cold. Speculation that Apple was working to develop its own PMICs had been swirling in Silicon Valley for more than a year. \u201cIt was sort of a poorly kept secret that Apple was developing its own PMICs,\u201d said Kevin Anderson, a senior analyst covering power semiconductors at IHS Markit.  Recommended  Apple Pays $600 Million for Dialog\u2019s PMIC Business   Reading the tea leaves gave Dialog the opportunity to begin to diversify its portfolio. The firm had already begun to reduce its reliance on Apple \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which in 2015 accounted for 80% of its sales \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and began making a series of acquisitions that broadened its product portfolio, including buying Silego Technology for $306 million last year. (Recall that Dialog also stuck a deal to acquire Atmel for $4.6 billion in 2015, but that the deal was eventually cancelled when Microchip Technology trumped Dialog's offer). At this point, with the eventual loss of Apple's PMIC business a foregone conclusion, Dialog's very survival depends on executing its strategy of broadening its portfolio and customer base in IoT, mobile, automotive and computing/storage. The Apple deal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which includes an upfront payment of $300 million for Dialog products over the next three years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gives Dialog much needed clarity and cash to invest in diversifying its business, Anderson said. \u201cExploded view\u201d of iPhone 7 from teardown by IHS Markit.
