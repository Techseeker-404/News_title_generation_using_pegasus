The big dark spot on the horizon is a growing trade war between the U.S. and China. That was the outlook from a handful of analysts at a kickoff for the annual Semicon West event here. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are at or just beyond the peak in the economic growth cycle\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but the potential for political uncertainty is greater than it has been in a while and that could knock us off the growth path,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duncan Meldrum, chief economist at Hilltop Economics, forecasting a downturn will hit the capital equipment market next year and spread to the chip sector in 2020.

The trend is expected to continue until 2020 when more supply comes online. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen prices went up, demand did not decline as it used to. Consumers kept buying and made the DRAM guys very happy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that was exactly what the big three needed to build their 3D NAND fabs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bob Johnson, a research vice president at Gartner, referring to Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron. Looking forward, Johnson predicts DRAM density will increase at less than half its historic 32% rate. The big questions are whether in the next couple years China will start producing DRAMs, driving prices down, or alternative memory technologies will emerge, he said. NAND flash revenues are growing at a stately 9% compound rate, but will increasingly feel cost pressures of trying to stack more layers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf DRAM profits roll off as China comes online, NAND investments could be pinched,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson said.   The chip forecast looks like stair steps going forward, said Johnson.  Click to enlarge.

Meanwhile, the memory \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper-cycle\u00e2\u0080\u009d and China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chip ambitions are fueling unprecedented fab growth, said Clark Tseng, director of industry research and statistics for the SEMI trade group that hosts the event. Last year was a record in front-end fab investments. Fab spending in China is expected to surpass $10 billion this year and reach near $18 billion in 2019, exceeding spending in South Korea. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen four years of consecutive global fab growth since the 1990s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tseng said. \u00c2\u00a0 DRAM cost/MByte may never return to its traditional 32% a year decline.
