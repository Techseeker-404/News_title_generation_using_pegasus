The accelerator, focused on semiconductor startups, hopes to expand its geographic footprint in January and launch its first graduates soon. Like most of its partners, ON Semi joined Silicon Catalyst to get a better view of its pipeline of startups. The incubator screens hundreds of startups every year to select a handful that become portfolio companies, getting access to EDA and test tools and services from partners, including a shuttle run at TSMC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy role is to look outside the company and fill innovation and technology gaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mamoon Rashid, senior vice president of strategic ventures at ON Semi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis partnership gives us a view of the semiconductor startup environment \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there are a lot of incubators in software, but not a lot in semiconductors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not surprisingly, one of Silicon Catalyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newest startups is designing an accelerator for machine learning, an area that has reawakened an otherwise sleepy area of venture investing in silicon. Xceler Systems Inc. is designing an FPGA-like graph processor, promising substantially lower power than alternative chips for supervised and unsupervised learning. It eventually aims to make it based on the RISC-V architecture. Silicon Catalyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other new startup, Power Down Semiconductors, developed a process to recycle charge and prevent power losses in chips and displays. It focuses on the market for consumer electronics devices such as smartphones. Also in the Silicon Catalyst portfolio are the following startups with their products:  ACP Semi: Smart, integrated LEDs Aeponyx: MEMS-based silicon photonics switches Ayar Labs: Optical I/O blocks made in CMOS Chaos Prime: An IoT radio to withstand factory interference ClopTech: A 60-GHz radio Rex Computing: A parallel processor Spark Microsystems: A low-power IoT radio Zeno: Designer of a 1T SRAM  The company, announced in late 2014, takes 10% to 12% in equity in exchange for incubating startups for two years, providing them tools, services, connections, and mentoring. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have three companies nearing their two-year anniversary date, so we have to figure out how we do graduation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rick Lazansky, Silicon Catalyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times  Related posts:  Semiconductor IPOs Back in Vogue Leti Plans Startup Accelerator Advice for Silicon Startups Silicon Startups Get Incubator      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
