These awards are completely subjective and not particularly planned or coordinated with any of my colleagues at EE Times. One or two of these innovations weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite complete in 2017, and a couple were actually fully baked before the year started. This end-of-the-year reflection was inspired in part by an email from a former colleague asking me to contribute to his 2017 list of top innovators. Rather than try to name people, I chose to name things and hope all the people behind them will stand up and take a bow. My method was simple: I sifted through my tweets from the year (I tend to tweet out the headline of every major story I post) and scooped up the biggest nuggets I dredged up. So here they are in reverse order: #8 The March for Science:  Whoever organized this multi-city celebration in April did a great job tapping into a pent-up desire to celebrate technology, the scientific method and the people who honor and practice it. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if an annual event is sustainable, but I hope to see another one sometime soon. Go Science!    Every decade or so the hard disk drive industry has to reinvent its core technology. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost as if chip makers had to re-discover the equivalent of CMOS scaling every 10 years. Western Digital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on MAMR announced in October (and shown in a prototype drive by a WD product manager below) is impressive and takes nothing away from equally great work rival Seagate has pumped into its pioneering heat-assisted variant for many years. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the most sexy technology these days, but you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have quick access to years-old photos stored on Facebook pages and other cloud services without banks of HDDs.    I give Samsung the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of this award for both being a first mover and its August announcement of a Tbit NAND chip. Over the last few years Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineers showed the world a new kind of 3D design and manufacturing. It has not only revolutionized NAND flash but become the poster child for a kind of monolithic 3D design likely to become a mainstay for the semiconductor industry for many years to come. Rival NAND makers have become Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fast followers in the field, forced to pioneer innovations of their own given the heavy secrecy around how anyone is making these chips. Intel is mainly one of those followers, but it deserves some credit for trying to branch out into what history may see as the first (although likely not the most interesting) of an emerging class of storage-class memories with drives that debuted in March.    A few crack grad students and professors at Berkeley have done a lot in the past few years to spawn a new microprocessor architecture unencumbered by royalties. Their efforts also sparked new possibilities for open source hardware. Even the veteran co-founders of this movement are amazed this could happen given the consolidation and maturity of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s semiconductor industry.   "}
