The launch reignites competition in one of the most lucrative sectors of Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s x86 business. AMD announced nine Epyc processors, using its Zen x86 core to deliver 23\u00e2\u0080\u009370% more performance than Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 14-nm Broadwell parts across a range of benchmarks. All support eight 2,666-MHz DDR 4 channels and 128 PCI Express Gen 3 lanes, compared to about four memory channels and 40 PCIe lanes in the average Xeon. The chips arrive as Intel is about to roll out its first 14-nm Xeon chips based on its Skylake architecture. Some Epyc parts \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould still be ahead of Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming generation, but not as much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nathan Brookwood, principal of market watcher Insight64. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Epyc has a very real opportunity to disrupt Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two-socket server cash machine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kevin Krewell, senior analyst at Tirias Research. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntel has controlled that market well and has been able to protect its position while slowly increasing its ASPs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The 14-nm Epyc chips beat 14-nm Broadwell Xeons across a range of benchmarks.
