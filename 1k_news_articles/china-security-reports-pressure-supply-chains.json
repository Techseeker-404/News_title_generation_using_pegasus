Their products were seen as low cost and high customization.\u00c2\u00a0Fast forward to today, Super Micro is hardly to be found in the server shipments to the top five U.S. hyperscalers in the first half of 2018.\u00c2\u00a0 In fact, most server assembly is now done in Taiwan.\u00c2\u00a0That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that components don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come from China, just that the final assembly process has moved geographically. Meanwhile, most of the hyperscalers are following Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead and developing custom Smart NICs. The trend is something that makes sense architecturally while bringing the added benefit of making servers more secure. Thus, the inner workings of this critical part are harder for the outside world to learn and exploit. \u00c2\u00a0 At the Open Compute Project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event this year, Project Cerberus was demonstrated, showcasing a secure server using special chips and firmware.\u00c2\u00a0This innovation can help stop the exploits of bugs and hacking in a server during assembly, manufacturing, shipment or maintenance.\u00c2\u00a0 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reasonable debate over the details of the stories making headlines\u00c2\u00a0about hacking. Meanwhile cloud providers are taking security seriously by constantly hardening their infrastructure against cyber-attacks. More attention on security is good for consumers and\u00c2\u00a0businesses alike.\u00c2\u00a0As a result, security along with an ongoing China/U.S. trade war will put increasing pressure on supply chain management and the places where components are sourced. \u00c2\u00a0 \u2013Alan Weckel is founder and technology analyst at 650 Group, focusing on the data center, the cloud and the Internet of Things.
