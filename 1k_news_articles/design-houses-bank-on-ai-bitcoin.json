The players in this business are trying to develop ICs rather than using off-the-shelf GPUs, according to the company. Customers are finding that the efficiency of GPUs is not good enough, GUC says. The Bitcoin-mining business has quickly popped up for foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and other companies in the TSMC ecosystem. GUC customer Bitmain, a privately held Chinese firm that makes Bitcoin-mining hardware and runs its own mining operations, made $3 billion to $4 billion in profits in 2017, according to estimates by Bernstein Research. New mining equipment vendors have rushed in to capitalize on the boom. The focus now is on developing more customized machines that offer greater efficiency. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNowadays, GPUs are used as ASSPs for the AI market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said GUC Senior Director Lewis Chu, in an interview with EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut AI is big data, algorithms. If everyone continues to use ASSPs, it means their algorithms are similar. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for them to do differentiation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d GUC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chu started his career as a chip designer for Motorola and went to TSMC around the time Motorola spun off Freescale. He later joined GUC. If Amazon or Facebook continues to use off-the-shelf chips, it might not be easy for the internet giants to implement their internal knowhow, according to Chu. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is why many data centers would now like to have their own ASICs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chu says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will be the trend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Design houses help limit the risks involved with making a custom chip. The design of an ASIC in the 16nm to 7nm range costs anywhere from $100 million to $400 million today. Most companies staking their brands on a bespoke chip are too risk-averse to take on that cost if the chance of a design failure is high. If the run rate for the chip doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exceed 2 million units, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a losing proposition. Even so, the design business is looking good. Design starts for AI voice-activated device ASICs will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) approaching 20 percent by 2021, nearly twice the 10.1 percent CAGR of all ASIC design starts between 2016 and 2021, according to a report by Semico Research. GUC, whose sales soared 31 percent last year, is a spinoff of TSMC and still works exclusively with the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest foundry. GUC rival Faraday Technology, a spinoff from United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), says ASICs account for about two-thirds of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business. Other Taiwan chip designers like MediaTek and Alchip Technologies are also chasing the business. "}
