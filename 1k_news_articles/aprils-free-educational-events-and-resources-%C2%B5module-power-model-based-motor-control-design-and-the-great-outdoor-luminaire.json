For residential and commercial installations and in public spaces, well-designed outdoor lighting makes for a safer, more appealing environment. If you design outdoor luminaires or are looking to maximize the efficacy of LED-based applications, register for our webinar later this month on optimizing your designs to exceed DLC Premium requirements. Also this month, learn how to use system-in-package (SiP) \u00c2\u00b5Modules to simplify power design while maximizing efficiency, even if you have limited switch-mode power supply design expertise. And explore the benefits of a model-based design workflow for motor control system development through a demonstration based on the NXP MagniV microcontroller. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to sign up for one or more of these free events but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attend live, go ahead and register anyway. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll send you a link to view the webinar or webcast at your convenience. TechOnline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design assists go well beyond our webinars and webcasts. Our white paper library offers application notes, expert tips and reports from the engineering trenches to help you tackle your most intractable design problems. This month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highlighted white papers suggest three reasons for using machined receptacles in connector designs (price isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one of them); ask the tough questions about decibels (why does 1% work out to be \u00e2\u0080\u009340 dB one time but 0.1 dB or 0.05 dB the next time?); and define a high-speed, multi-protocol SerDes architecture for advanced-node designs (this one is FinFET-ready). Also check out TechOnline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courses to explore a topic that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new to you or to brush up on the basics. Our featured course this month covers the fundamentals of printed-circuit-board design. \u00c2\u00a0 Webinars/webcasts: system-in-package power, model-based workflow for motor control, exceeding DLC Premium   Simplify Power Designs with Micromodule Products (April 19): If you design power equipment for aerospace, datacom, telecom, industrial, transportation or medical applications, register for our webcast on \u00c2\u00b5Module power products to learn how the SiP approach can address time and space constraints while delivering high efficiency and low EMI. No switcher design experience? No problem. Presenters from Analog Devices and Arrow will demonstrate how a \u00c2\u00b5Module regulator can be used to implement a complete switch-mode power supply in a compact, efficient package with minimal to no design effort required.\u00c2\u00a0   Design and Develop Motor Control Applications with NXP MagniV MCUs using Model-Based Design (April 24): This webinar will underscore the benefits of model-based design for development of complex control systems. NXP will describe a MagniV microcontroller-based design and development workflow for a field-oriented control system for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor. The workflow will guide you through model simulation using software- and processor-in-the-loop (SIL/PIL) models and model deployment on the real-time microcontroller.   How to Maximize Efficacy in your Outdoor Luminaire (April 25): With a focus on maximizing efficacy, presenters from Lumileds and Arrow will describe the key attributes and system-level benefits of a new LED emitter that offers breakthrough performance to exceed the DesignLights Consortium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DLC Premium requirements, even at 3,000 K (for \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarm\u00e2\u0080\u009d light). The presenters will review all aspects of system optimization \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as mechanical and electrical design, optical control, thermal management and power solutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to illustrate the cost/performance benefits of a cohesive design approach.   \u00c2\u00a0 White papers: machined receptacles, decibels demystified, SerDes in the fast lane   3 Reasons to Use Machined Pin Receptacles in your Connector Design (Mill-Max Mfg.): Particularly for safety-critical and mission-critical applications, reliability is one factor that figures more highly than price when choosing a receptacle design. Read this white paper to learn the other design considerations that might have you looking beyond price.   dB or not dB? Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Decibels But Were Afraid to Ask (Rohde & Schwarz): The writer observes that decibels are \u00e2\u0080\u009cfound everywhere, including power levels, voltages, reflection coefficients, noise figures, field strengths and more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and yet even seasoned engineers can be left scratching their heads when using decibels in their calculations. This application note is a helpful refresher on the topic, so go ahead and ask those questions. No one will judge you.   Defining a New High-Speed, Multi-Protocol SerDes Architecture for Advanced Nodes (Cadence Design Systems): Designing a high-speed, high-performance serializer/deserializer for advanced process nodes can be challenging on many levels, including speed, channel loss and power constraints. This paper defines a high-speed, multi-protocol SerDes that stands up to advanced-node design challenges.   \u00c2\u00a0 Course: board design basics, but not just for beginners   Fundamentals of PCB Design (Mentor Graphics): Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an experienced schematics designer or a beginner, printed-circuit-board design and layout may be new to you. This course gets you started, detailing the process as well as sharing valuable manufacturing insider knowledge. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an old hand, this 45-minute course will help you avoid common pitfalls and create better designs.       Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
