In recent years, V2X diverged into two different technologies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 DSRC and C-V2X \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with fundamentally different architectures, making it difficult to harmonize a single global solution. While DSRC-based V2X is deployed in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, C-V2X is gaining momentum in other regions, including China. Autotalks says that its chipset now supports DSRC based on the 802.11p/ITS-G5 standards and C-V2X based on 3GPP specifications. It delivers dual-mode (DSRC and C-V2X) functionality on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing automotive-qualified AEC-Q100 Grade 2 chipsets and maintains the present API, enabling a global dual-mode V2X platform to be delivered much more quickly than before. Autotalks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 PC5 solution utilizes the globally defined 5.9-GHz ITS spectrum for V2X and is cellular-network-agnostic (no cellular SIM or coverage required, works with or without any 3G/4G/5G cellular modem). Separating V2X from the cellular network access device (NAD) improves the cost-effectiveness of telematic control unit (TCU) deployments. The separation of V2X from in-vehicle infotainment ensures that the purpose of the V2X system, which is giving drivers alerts of on-road dangers, is not compromised. Autotalks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 software-defined radio architecture enables a single chipset to address both DSRC and C-V2X technologies.Source: Autotalks  CEO Hagai Zyss said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutotalks is proud to announce that its existing second-generation chipset can now support PC5.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He told EE Times that the emergence of two different V2X standards \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one relying on Wi-Fi standards and the other on cellular network connectivity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meant that it was difficult to reach economies of scale that a global mass-market chipset would allow. Hence, the company developed a solution using its existing silicon, which is already being deployed, with a software-defined toggle enabling the developer to switch between the V2X technologies. It has been able to do so by sharing many of the common elements used by the two technologies (DSRC and C-V2X). Among the shared elements in both cases are DSP resources, memories, hardware signal processing elements, and the RF IC for the globally harmonized ITS spectrum (5.9 GHz). As a result, Autotalks says that this creates one global hardware platform with one certification process, which will save time and hassle for OEMs and Tier Ones alike and will provide the needed stability for long-term support of V2X technology. It will also reduce the total cost of ownership for OEMs to deploy a V2X system by lowering the cost of sourcing, logistics, inventory, and other expenses. Consequently, economies of scale will create a cost-effective product that can be deployed in motorcycles, economy vehicles, and premium vehicles around the world. Zyss said that Autotalks has many strategic collaborations and investors, such as those with Bosch and Hyundai, and will see deployment of its chipset in the 2020 timeframe. In July 2018, Hyundai Motor invested a \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant amount\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Autotalks as part of a strategic partnership to accelerate the development and deployment of a next-generation chipset for connected cars. Hyundai said that it was expanding partnerships in the connectivity field to further strengthen connectivity technology vital to autonomous driving and explore new business opportunities within smart city infrastructure. Yunseong Hwang, director of the open innovation business group at Hyundai Motor Company, commented, \u00e2\u0080\u009cConnectivity is one of the core technologies that can be applied to smart city business models, as well as autonomous driving and infotainment. Hyundai will continue to invest in disruptive technologies that are in line with Hyundai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current and future strategic pillars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nitin Dahad is a European correspondent for EE Times.
