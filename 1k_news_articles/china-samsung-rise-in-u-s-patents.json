The U.S. Patent and Trademark office issued 320,003 utility grants in 2017, up 5.2% from the previous year. U.S. patents grew just 2% in 2016, rebounding from a rare 1% decline in 2015, blamed generally on a bad economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more or less back on trend now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Larry Clady, a senior analyst at IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, which released its annual report on the subject. IBM remains in first place with 9,043 grants in 2017, up 12% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 its 25th  year as the U.S. patent leader. Samsung is only 150 patents behind if you count all five divisions of the conglomerate in the Top 100. Samsung Electronics ranked second, up 6%, and Samsung Display was 10th . U.S. companies lead the list, but China is on the rise, growing its patent awards 28% last year, passing Taiwan to take fifth place. Two of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rising LCD makers were among the fastest-growing companies on the list. BOE Technology Group rose 63%, jumping from #40 to #21 with 1,413 grants. The company formed in 1993 runs nine LCD fabs, is building a 10.5-generation plant, and has annual revenues of more than $8 billion. It ranked seventh this year in semiconductor patents, ahead of Intel at #9, which has most of its patents in computers and networking. Another LCD maker in China, Shenzhen China Star Optoelectronics, was up 44% to #45 with 708 new U.S. patents. It was founded by TV giant TCL with investment from Samsung in 2009 and now has four fabs running or under construction.   China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LCD giant, BOE, surged to #21 in U.S. patents in 2017. Click to enlarge.

It trails its archrivals: Google, which has been in the Top 10 for several years, and Amazon, which leaped into the Top 20 last year. Intel rose two notches to #4 on the overall list. However, TSMC leads in semiconductor patents, followed by IBM, Samsung, Samsung Display, SEL of Japan, and Globalfoundries. Machine learning was one of a handful of rapidly growing patent categories that IFI called out this year for the first time. IBM and Google led in the AI category. Autonomous cars was another hot topic this year. It, along with patents in hot areas such as AI and 3D printing, helped drive Toshiba, Ford, and Hyundai up in the rankings to #14, #15, and #24, respectively. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times   "}
