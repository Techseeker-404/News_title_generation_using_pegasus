On approaching the store entrance, a group of scientists spray the unsuspecting family with an experimental drug. Immediately the adults\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes burn and the children experience severe breathing difficulties. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d scream the parents. The scientists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 two-word answer is instant and emotionless: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaving lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This scenario would never happen because the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has tightly defined protocols for testing new drugs on humans. The FDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrug Development Process\u00e2\u0080\u009d comprises five stages, where drugs are tested on people to make sure they are safe and effective only at the third stage. Click the above to enlarge. (Source: NorthEast BioLab) Writing in a detailed post about the process, Abhay Pandey observes: How long do you think it takes for a new drug to get approved in the US? About 12-15 years, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roughly 1/3rd duration of the entire professional career for any of us. Next, how much investment do you think is required to bring a new drug to market? ~$1 Billion, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equivalent to employing 665+ employees at the annual salary of $100k for 15 years. It is morally and ethically repugnant to test experimental drugs on unsuspecting, non-consenting subjects. It is also against the law. So why is it okay to test experimental automated or autonomous vehicle (AV) technology on public roads using unsuspecting, non-consenting humans? How can a promise of \u00e2\u0080\u009csaving lives\u00e2\u0080\u009d tomorrow possibly be justification for placing the public at risk today? Am I alone in believing we are witnessing one of the greatest public safety scandals of a generation? Is it really okay for government officials and safety agencies to stand idly by and allow the tech industry to turn public roads into a laboratory and to turn non-consenting citizens into guinea pigs? How did we end up with the AV foxes guarding the public hen house? These questions are too broad and too complex to address in detail in a single article in the pages of EE Times. But as I looked further into the specifics of the matter, these are some of the issues that really grabbed my attention. Lies, damned lies and \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman error\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to figures from the World Health Organization, humans are responsible for more than 1.3 million traffic-related deaths globally each year. Preliminary data from the National Safety Council show that as many as 42,060 people are estimated to have died in motor vehicle crashes in 2020 in the U.S. (Source: WHO) That technology has the potential to substantially reduce traffic fatalities is indisputable. However, whether this takes the form of driver monitoring and assistance technology to make human drivers into safer drivers, or automated driving systems (ADS) that take humans partially or entirely out of the driving loop, is a subject of debate right across the automotive, human factors, technology and policy-making spectrum. To aid its policy-making process, NHTSA has issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the development of a framework for ADS safety. The submission made by the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, an organization comprised of leading AV developers, attracted my attention and in particular the declaration that: an estimated 94% of all crashes are due to human error, including reckless, drunk, and distracted driving. Okay, stop right there. This is an official submission document to NHTSA by a coalition representing companies testing experimental AV technology on public roads including Argo AI, Aurora, Cruise, Embark, Ford, Kodiak, Lyft, Motional, Nuro, TuSimple, Uber, Volvo Cars, Waymo, and Zoox. The assertion that \u00e2\u0080\u009c94% of all crashes are due to human error\u00e2\u0080\u009d is now repeated so frequently and so glibly that few seem to appreciate that it is a factual misrepresentation of NHTSA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own data. The earliest publication of the relevant data that I can find comes from the February 2015 edition of NHTSA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cTraffic Safety Facts\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I screenshotted the relevant table in the figure below. (Source: NHTSA) Note that the entry specifically reads \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrivers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d not \u00e2\u0080\u009cHumans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is not a persnickety observation. The premise that replacing human drivers with machine drivers will \u00e2\u0080\u009csave lives\u00e2\u0080\u009d is unsubstantiated propaganda, yet it forms the foundation of the argument from the AV industry justifying the use of its experimental technology on public roads. [Editor\u2019s note: \u201c94% human error\u201d myth was well explained by Phil Koopman, co-founder of Edge Case Research, in his Safe Autonomy blog posted in 2018. Referring to the original NHTSA\u2019s 2008 report, he explains that if something goes wrong and the driver should have (arguably) been able to avoid the crash, the mishap \u00e2\u0080\u009creason\u00e2\u0080\u009d is assigned to the driver. That\u2019s not at all the same thing as the accident being the driver\u2019s fault to due an overt error that directly triggered the mishap. To its credit that original report makes this clear.] Human failings as drivers are principally related to distraction, drowsiness and impairment, which can be mitigated through the use of robust driver monitoring systems. As the March 2018 Uber crash in Tempe, Arizona, showed, the failings of machine drivers are instead principally related to path planning, perception and prediction, which resulted in the death of Elaine Herzberg. I find tech and AV companies referring to \u00e2\u0080\u009c94% human error\u00e2\u0080\u009d in their press releases and keynote speeches irritating. However, searching questions need to be asked when an AV industry consortium attempts to influence official government policy by using factually incorrect statements. Safe, safety and safely According to press announcements, Waymo has driven more than 20 million miles on public roads across over 25 cities. Waymo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website has an entire section devoted to safety and its whitepaper entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaymo Public Road Safety Performance Data\u00e2\u0080\u009d declares: Most of these historical miles have been driven with a trained vehicle operator seated in the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat who can take over the driving task Can anyone direct me to the official government research which proves that this testing method is safe? Who devised the safety driver training program? Who certifies a safety driver as safe? Which government agency tests, licenses and monitors these safety drivers? Who is accountable? How safe is safe enough? The game appears to be to just use the word \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A lot. For instance, the biography for Mauricio Pe\u00c3\u00b1a, Waymo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current Chief Safety Officer, reads: Mauricio oversees all of Waymo\u2019s safety efforts and teams, including system safety, field safety, fleet operations safety, and safety research. Mauricio is also responsible for continuing to advance Waymo\u2019s Safety Methodologies and road safety performance data and fostering openness and transparency around these methodologies with industry stakeholders. So, everything Waymo does is safe because Waymo says safe a lot? Clearly nothing to see here. No conflicts of interest. No minimum standards. No burden of proof. No federal oversight is required that is similar to the FDA. But is it really okay for AV companies to socialize test and development risk on public roads with a goal to privatize the profits, all the while hiding behind the free pass of \u00e2\u0080\u009csaving lives\u00e2\u0080\u009d? How stupid do they think we are? Have a go at safety driving The AV industry asserts that humans experience distraction and fatigue as drivers, but asks us to trust the very same humans will function perfectly when trained as vehicle operators that can safely take over the driving task on demand. Is that believable? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s find out. Hold your arms out in front of you, palms facing up and pull your elbows into your chest. Now watch the video below and all you have to do is concentrate on the rotating steering wheel. This will only take 20 minutes.  (The relevant footage starts at 2:20 in) How did you get on? I found my neck and back were sore in under five minutes, my concentration had wandered after ten and I gave up with boredom before fifteen minutes. I found the voiceover distracting and on the long straight roads where the steering wheel remained static, the experience was excruciatingly dull. While not a perfect simulation, it is nevertheless enlightening. Could you perform that task reliably? Hour after hour, day after day and late at night? How would you assess your suitability as a safety driver? Safety driving looks mentally and physically exhausting and incredibly boring, yet the safety driver is the last line of defense before a fatal collision. We can now see the inconvenient truth that humans experience distraction, drowsiness and mind-wandering whether they are driving vehicles or supervising test-level vehicle automation. We also have some hard data on this problem that we can refer to, courtesy of Seeing Machines. (Source: Seeing Machines) The data is gathered by Guardian, which is a fleet of more than 25,000 heavy trucks installed with an aftermarket driver monitoring system that provides real-time analysis and alerts for driver distraction and fatigue. Waymo uses a variant of this product in its test fleet, called the Guardian Backup-driver Monitoring System. No AV company has publicly disclosed that it uses this product, not even Waymo. The Guardian data show that across the approximately 4 billion miles monitored to date, truck drivers experienced a distraction event roughly once every 450 miles and a fatigue event (where the driver is assessed to be asleep) roughly once every 8,200 miles. The epidemic of distraction and fatigue in truck drivers is discussed in detail in this report prepared on behalf of the Australian National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. While not a perfect comparison, the data suggest Waymo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 20 million miles driven on public roads would equate to approximately 44,000 distraction events for its safety drivers, and approximately 2,400 fatigue events. Policymakers and safety advocates who wish to understand more about this technology should direct their questions to Dr. Mike Lenn\u00c3\u00a9, Chief of Human Factors & Safety at Seeing Machines. The scandal that can continue no longer Under the FDAs testing protocols it takes about 12-15 years for a new drug to get approval in the U.S. so it is no surprise that AV tech companies are already actively recruiting lobbyists to influence policy making at the highest levels of government, prior to any federal regulations being introduced. Click the above to enlarge. As this example shows, Waymo is currently recruiting for a role in which the candidate will: Develop and maintain strong bipartisan relationships with Members of Congress and their staff, as well as with federal regulatory officials and other key external stakeholders as needed. For an industry that is so focused on the safe operation of its technology, surprisingly little attention is being paid to the issue of safe testing. There exists no obvious government oversight regarding this matter, nor even a democratic debate about whether experimental AV technology should continue to be tested on public roads at all. Simply endlessly repeating the word \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a process safe. With a dodgy submission made to NHTSA by a coalition of AV companies, clear limitations to the suitability of humans as safety drivers and leading AV companies openly lobbying Congress to influence rule-making in their favor, just one point comes across loud and clear to me: Having the AV foxes guard the public hen house is a safety scandal that can continue no longer.
