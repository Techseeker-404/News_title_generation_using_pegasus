The companies are targeting the need for more intelligence at the edge of IoT systems, providing integrated solutions based on S3 Semiconductor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ASICs and Adesto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memory products. Dermot Barry, vice president and general manager of S3 Semiconductors, told EE Times that the company has evolved over the last 30 years from pure IC design services to a mixed-signal and RF IP supplier and, more recently, to a turnkey ASIC design and supply company. As a result, it had received a number of approaches from potential acquirers in the last few years. \u201cOne of these approaches was from Adesto, and as the conversation developed, it became clear it was a good fit for the markets we are going after,\u201d he said. Adesto has a focus on IoT memories, and this makes for an ideal partnership with S3 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially with a general trend toward more intelligence at the edge. Barry explained that in industrial IoT, in which latency can be a big issue when sending data to the cloud and waiting for a response, there is a need for more solutions to process and analyze data at the edge.
