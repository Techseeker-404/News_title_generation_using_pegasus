SEMI, the chip industry trade group, reported this week that silicon revenues remain stable in 2020, mainly on the strength of slightly higher wafer shipments. Silicon shipments totaled 12,407 million square inches. That total works out to a 5-percent increase on an annual basis. Last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total also approached record high silicon shipments recorded in 2018. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilicon wafer shipment growth [in 2020] was driven by healthy 300-millimeter demand and a strong second half of 2020 despite disruptions to the semiconductor industry caused by Covid-19,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Neil Weaver, chairman SEMI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Silicon Manufacturers Group and vice president for product development and applications engineering at silicon wafer manufacturer Shin Etsu Handotai America.  SEMI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual silicon industry results include polished silicon wafers such as test wafers and epitaxial silicon wafers along with non-polished silicon wafers shipped to end users. The totals do not include a growing number of solar energy applications, the group noted. Late last month, the chip industry group reported a modest monthly increase in North American semiconductor manufacturing equipment billings. While the three-month moving average had hovered well above 20 percent since last summer, the December billing total of $2.68 billion represented a modest 7.6 percent increase over the same period last year. Still, Ajit Manocha, SEMI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president and CEO, said the 2020 equipment billings surpassed the previous record also set in 2018. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe record high demonstrates the semiconductor industry\u2019s central role in enabling the digital transformation throughout the pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manocha added.  Meanwhile, bullish semiconductor market forecasts for 2021 growth range as high as 14 percent, reflecting what analysts hope will be a broad-based recovery from the pandemic.
