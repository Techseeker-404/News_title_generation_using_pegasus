Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) of China accounted for the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of infrastructure spending followed by foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), according to IC Insights. The chip market tracker reported this week that foundry capital spending jumped a hefty 38 percent year-on-year, totaling $36.3 billion. Just two short years ago, foundry capex was in steep decline, plummeting 16 percent on an annual basis. The ramp to finer semiconductor geometries accounts for much of the recent surge in spending on manufacturing gear. SEMI reported last week that equipment billings jumped 30 percent on an annual basis during the third quarter. \u00c2\u00a0South Korean and Chinese chip makers were the biggest spenders., the industry group said, while North American quarterly bookings slumped 45 percent, year-on-year. Meanwhile, IC Insights said it expects overall semiconductor capital investments to rise 6 percent this year to just over $108 billion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith a focus on being the leading provider of 7/5nm process technology, TSMC accounted for essentially all of the increase in foundry capital expenditures in 2019,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the analyst said. This year, it estimates TSMC will contribute 20 percent of the foundry capex increase while SMIC accounts for as much as 39 percent of fab investments. SEMI predicted in September that Chinese foundries would for the first time become the largest buyers of fab tools as SMIC and other fabs ramp up memory production.  Aside from increased quarterly spending on logic chip fabrication, up a modest 6 percent, all other chip sectors covered by the capex tracker declined over the same period last year. The biggest laggards were memory, including DRAM and SRAM (-13 percent) and analog and related devices (-10 percent, year-on-year). While quarterly infrastructure spending for flash and non-volatile memory remained flat at $22.7 billion, IC Insights estimates that increased spending on 3D NAND manufacturing propped up the sector. Similarly, spending on flash manufacturing is forecast to outpace the dormant DRAM sector by a hefty 37 percent. Despite reduced DRAM spending this year, market leaders Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Micron Technology are all expected to remain among this year leading capex investors. SK Hynix acquired Intel Corp.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NAND flash operations in October. IC Insights reiterated the semiconductor sector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing resilience during the pandemic, noting that 21 of 33 chip categories it tracks survived and even thrived as Covid-19 accelerates a global transition to digital platforms.
