It is the latest in a growing crowd of efforts to deliver silicon that accelerates a rapidly evolving set of algorithms and workloads. The Tensilica Vision C5 packs 1,024 8-bit multiple-accumulate units using a 128-way SIMD architecture to deliver 1 TMAC/sec, four times the performance of its existing P6 DSP. It sports about 200 new instructions geared to run all neural network computational layers for inference jobs in automotive, surveillance, and mobile systems. More than 20 chip design starts worldwide are now in the works, aiming to use some form of computer vision and machine-learning capabilities, said Pulin Desai, a product marketing director for Cadence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe went through all of the neural network architectures, and they are changing almost daily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The core helps Cadence catch up with rival designs from Ceva and Synopsys, said Mike Demler, an analyst with The Linley Group. The C5 \u00e2\u0080\u009cappears to nudge ahead of the Synopsys EV6x, which can do 880 MACs/cycle, but the EV6x has 12-bit resolution versus C5 8-bit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn comparison, the Ceva XM6 can perform 512 16-bit MACs/cycle in its CNN accelerator \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [although the Tensilica P6] trailed far behind the performance of Ceva and Synopsys Vision processor cores, the C5 should be at least comparable in performance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.  The C5 DSP uses 8- and 16-bit MACs and about 200 new instructions geared for neural networks. Click to enlarge. (Source: Cadence) "}
