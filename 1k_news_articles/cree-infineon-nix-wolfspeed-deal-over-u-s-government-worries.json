Following the termination of the transaction, Cree (Durham, N.C.) reversed course and said it would continue running the Wolfspeed business and report its financials as a separate segment of its continuing operations. Cree had said last July that the proposed sale of Wolfspeed to Infineon was triggered by Cree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy to heighten its focus on being an LED lighting company. \u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Wolfspeed business has performed well this year as our customers have further realized the value of our unique technology and is on a great path as a part of Cree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chuck Swoboda, Cree chairman and CEO, in a press statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe strength of our balance sheet and improving operating cash flow gives us the ability to invest in Wolfspeed, while continuing to pursue our LED and lighting growth plans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As a result of the acquisition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s termination, Infineon must pay a $12.5 million fee to Cree, Cree said. Both Cree and Infineon said earlier this month that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CIFUS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a multi-agency government committee that has the power to block acquisitions on U.S. national security grounds\u00e2\u0080\u0094had raised concerns about the deal. At the time, both companies said they would explore whether the sale could be pushed through under terms that CIFUS would agree to, including potential divestiture of some of the Wolfspeed business. It is unclear what specifically about the deal raised national security concerns. CIFUS does not disclose details of its investigations because it is prohibited by law from doing so. But Cree has in the past touted Wolfspeed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GaN-on-SiC RF technology for military applications. \u00e2\u0080\u0094Dylan McGrath covers the semiconductor industry and business news for EE Times.
