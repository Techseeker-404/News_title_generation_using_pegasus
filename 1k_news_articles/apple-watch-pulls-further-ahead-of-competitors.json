Apple shipped nearly 9 million units of Apple Watch Series 3 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the latest version which adds for the first time standalone cellular connectivity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 making up nearly half of total Apple Watch shipments for the year, Canalys said. \u201cApple has won the wearables game,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jason Low, a senior analyst at Canalys, in a press statement. Low said that Apple has pulled far ahead of competitors by continuing to focus on its core iPhone user base, even while rivals have brought to market innovative designs featuring things such as rotating bezels and circular screens. Canalys said Series 3 was in strong demand in the U.S., Japan and Australia, where all major operators stoked it in time for the holiday season.   \u201cBut limited operator selection in the UK, Germany and France influenced consumer purchase decisions, and stifled the growth potential of the connected Apple Watch,\u201d said Vincent Thielke, a Canalys research analyst at Canalys. \u201cMoving into new markets, such as Singapore and Hong Kong in Q1 2018, just in time for Chinese New Year, is a good move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thielke added. In all, Apple Watch shipments increased about 54 percent in 2017, Canalys said. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.       Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
