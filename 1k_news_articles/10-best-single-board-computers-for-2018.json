As with any new development technology, this sparks healthy debates among users as to which boards are the best and why some others were not included. This ultimately boils down to \u00e2\u0080\u009csorting logic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning that they can be sorted in many ways \u00e2\u0080\u0094 price points, performance, form factors, user communities, and so forth. Applications also factor into this equation, as task-based SPCs are wide-ranging and handle everything from industrial automation to UAV controllers. As a result, this top 10 roundup focuses on mainstream SBCs that hobbyists, makers, and engineers can use for any number of projects whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re newcomers to the community or 30-year IT veterans. With that said, here are the top 10 mainstream single-board computers currently on the market, or will be for the fall of 2018.

For 2018, the company launched the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, an improved version of its predecessor with some notable new features, which includes a 64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A53 SoC (@ 1.4 GHz) outfitted with a metal heat sink to handle the increased 200 MHz over the Pi 3.  The board also features dual-band 802.11ac wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.2, Gigabyte Ethernet (Over USB 2.0), and PoE support (using a separate PoE HAT). Rounding out the Pi 3 Model B+ is an extended 40-pin GPIO header, full-sized HDMI port, four USB 2.0 ports, CSI camera port, DSI display port, and stereo and composite video ports.

The Ryzen Zen architecture combines both a multi-core Zen processor with a Vega GPU, allowing it to drive high-end VR and AI applications. UDOO capitalized on the APU and designed a pair of boards to handle most any project thrown at it.  The midrange BOLT V3 runs an AMD Ryzen dual-core (quad-thread) V1202B APU (with a Vega 3 GPU), while the BOLT V8 packs an AMD Ryzen quad-core (eight-thread) V1605B APU (with a Vega 8 GPU). That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the differences between the two boards end, as each offers identical hardware, including an SSD card slot, an SATA 3.0 connector, a pair of HDMI ports, and two display ports (via USB Type-C).  Both models also feature two DIMM slots for up to 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, come with 32 GB of on-board flash memory, and are Arduino-Leonardo-compatible, with up to 23 I/Os (seven PWM, one UART, one I2C, one SPI, and 12 analog). The boards do have a couple of drawbacks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there are no wireless capabilities (although you can add Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other aftermarket modules), and UDOO is only offering the board through a Kickstarter campaign.
