This article, along with the articles listed on the last page, form an in-depth look from a variety of angles at the business and technology of imbuing embedded systems with localized AI.\u00c2\u00a0  SAN JOSE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to list semiconductor companies working on some form of artificial intelligence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pretty much all of them are. The broad potential for machine learning is drawing nearly every chip vendor to explore the still-emerging technology, especially in inference processing at the edge of the network. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems like every week, I run into a new company in this space, sometimes someone in China that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never heard of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Kanter, a microprocessor analyst at Real World Technologies. Deep neural networks are essentially a new way of computing. Instead of writing a program to run on a processor that spits out data, you stream data through an algorithmic model that filters out results in what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called inference processing. The approach started getting attention after the 2012 ImageNet contest, when some algorithms delivered better results identifying pictures than a human. Computer vision was the first field to feel a big boost. Since then, web giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook have started applying deep learning to video, speech, and translation. Last year, more than 300 million smartphones shipped with some form of neural-networking capabilities; 800,000 AI accelerators will ship to data centers this year; and every day, 700 million people now use some form of smart personal assistant like an Amazon Echo or Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Siri. [Partnered Content: Can complex AI software be executed on mobile devices?] As many as 50 companies are already said to be selling or preparing some form of silicon AI accelerators. Some are IP blocks for SoCs, some are chips, and a few are systems. They share a goal of being designed into everything from data center servers to smartphones, smart speakers, and a host of other products. In a sign of how pervasive the technology may become, researchers from Toshiba recently presented a paper on a neural-network accelerator block designed to be embedded in a sensor. The core technology is still evolving. As many as 50 technical papers on AI are published daily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going up \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a more exciting field,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Patterson, the veteran co-developer of RISC who worked on Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit.
