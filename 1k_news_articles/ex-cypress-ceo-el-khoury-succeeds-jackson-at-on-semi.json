El-Khoury became a free agent after having negotiated the sale of Cypress to Infineon for a little over $10 billion last year. The sale was announced in 2019, but it was held up a bit as the Trump Administration considered blocking it, before ultimately granting its approval. The deal ended up being finalized last April. Jackson announced his retirement a little over two months ago, in late September. On Semi board chairman Alan Campbell said the search committee interviewed both internal and external candidates, and finally settled on El-Khoury, who Campbell said was selected for his experience.

Rogers at Cypress Semiconductor CEO Interview: ON Semi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Keith Jackson \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Oct 2020 podcast  El-Khoury, born and raised in Lebanon and educated in the United States, spent 13 years at Cypress, climbing the ranks to become president and CEO. Along the way, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d held various roles spanning business unit management, product development, applications engineering and business development. Prior to joining Cypress, El-Khoury, who describes himself as \u201cautomotive enthusiast,\u201d spent eight years at Continental Automotive Systems, working as a senior design engineer. Hassane El-Khoury Jackson, meanwhile, had taken over what was essentially the cast-off parts of other chip companies, and with one opportunistic acquisition after another grew On Semi from a company with revenue of a little over $1 billion a year to $5.5 billion operation that for the last few years has been right around the cut-off point for the Fortune 500. El-Khoury is taking over the reins of a company that is at once a giant kludge and one of the most broadly diversified IC companies in the business. A spokesman for On Semi wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe understands that the industry is experiencing a major shift right now. However, Hassane plans to remain faithful to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals, culture and quality assurance to its employees and customers while tackling some of the ongoing transitions for the semiconductor industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Campbell in his prepared comments also mentioned \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe transformation underway in our business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Neither saw fit to specify what that transformation is. As planned, Jackson will remain at the company as an advisor through the end of May 2021.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
