Well, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, it was quiet. There was nothing new, except some bigger TVs and faster Internet. Just kidding, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a white-knuckle roller-coaster of a ride, with some game-changing technology already here and more on the horizon. Here are my top ten takeaways from the press days, the keynotes, and the time I spent with the exhibitors and innovators on the show floor. Of course, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to see everything. The show, which drew more than 180,000 attendees from more than 155 countries, stretched across the Las Vegas Convention Center and ten hotels.\u00c2\u00a0 The 4,500 exhibitors brought technology from every conceivable product category from 3D printing to wireless.\u00c2\u00a0 CES, which kicked off in New York in 1967 with 250 exhibitors and 17,500 attendees has become an annual pilgrimage for the electronics industry. More than letting folks know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening now, CES is a venue that gives attendees a glimpse into the future. Some of the hottest topics included 5G, artificial intelligence, automated assistants, and autonomous vehicles. Organizations are grappling with how to leverage rather than simply contain the data that they have and how to connect with other organizations to create world class partnerships that shape the industry. \u00c2\u00a0The show also provided ample opportunity to redefine innovation, resiliency and other buzzwords to shape how the industry will look in the future.

Just as a footnote I wanted to add how every year I am blown away by how much research and development effort goes in to mimicking some of the everyday tasks that we take for granted and do so skillfully, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even close! Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hear it for humanity, we are truly awesome, complex, and beautiful!      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
