Why WBG, and why GaN specifically? AspenCore Media\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new book, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAspenCore Guide to Gallium Nitride: A New Era for Power Electronics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answers those questions and more.  WBG\u00c2\u00a0power semiconductor devices in silicon carbide and GaN technology provide design advantages\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0are allowing previously unimaginable application\u00c2\u00a0performance:\u00c2\u00a0low leakage current, significantly reduced power losses, higher power density,\u00c2\u00a0higher-frequency operation,\u00c2\u00a0and the ability to\u00c2\u00a0tolerate higher operating temperatures, all with a smaller device size\u00c2\u00a0than\u00c2\u00a0could be achieved\u00c2\u00a0for a silicon-only\u00c2\u00a0equivalent.\u00c2\u00a0Other features,\u00c2\u00a0of no lesser importance,\u00c2\u00a0are robustness and increased reliability, resulting in improved overall device life expectancy and increased operational stability. GaN is one of the\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009ccoldest\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0alternatives\u00c2\u00a0to silicon that exist today, in the sense that its\u00c2\u00a0low junction resistance allows low\u00c2\u00a0device\u00c2\u00a0temperatures\u00c2\u00a0and low energy losses even\u00c2\u00a0in extreme, high-temperature operating conditions.\u00c2\u00a0GaN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s properties can provide clear benefits\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0power converters\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0consumer\u00c2\u00a0and industrial electronics; chargers for\u00c2\u00a0wireless\u00c2\u00a0devices, including 5G;\u00c2\u00a0driver circuits for\u00c2\u00a0motor control;\u00c2\u00a0power switches in\u00c2\u00a0automotive\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0space\u00c2\u00a0applications; efficient power conversion in\u00c2\u00a0data centers;\u00c2\u00a0smart\u00c2\u00a0metering for green\u00c2\u00a0energy\u00c2\u00a0installations;\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0imaging and wireless power for\u00c2\u00a0medical\u00c2\u00a0devices. GaN technology, implemented through transistors, has seen significant improvements that have brought down its cost enough to make it a viable MOSFET replacement. The momentum began to build in 2017, when the adoption rate of GaN in 48-Vin DC/DC converters \u00c2\u00a0achieved market-shifting proportions. Topologies such as multi-phase and multi-level buck converters now enable solutions with greater efficiency to cover the energy demands of the IT and automotive markets. In addition to GaN\u2019s microelectronics, digital control offers an extra boost to improve performance. By using GaN-based transistors and ICs, designers have been able to produce smaller chargers and adapters. GaN technology allows the development of converters that can operate at higher switching frequencies than equivalent silicon devices. It reduces transformer size, provides solutions that deliver significant system efficiency improvements, and reduces or eliminates the need for heat sinks. Power management  From a power management standpoint, \u00c2\u00a0all power systems require a high level of integration to achieve the required portability. High energy efficiency is required for truly portable and therefore battery-operated systems. Lower power consumption maximizes device operating time without recharging or replacing the batteries. The power supply industry for commercial applications is extremely dynamic; it has to be able to adapt to market changes, the introduction of new regulations, and the advent of new technologies, and as such it is under constant transformation. The industry must be capable of developing products and power solutions to support new technologies (such as 5G and Industry 4.0) and anticipate technologies that have yet to be introduced. Semiconductors such as GaN and SiC can provide effective solutions for the advancement of power electronics. Indeed, their broad-bandgap characteristics provide superior thermal management on the one hand and improved frequency response on the other. This results in more efficient, smaller, less expensive power electronics.

With the world on course to move from 8 billion to 30 billion connected devices over the next few years, data center operators and their suppliers need to\u00c2\u00a0rethink\u00c2\u00a0how these installations are powered. Will technology be up to the challenge of making data centers more efficient and sustainable, and what will GaN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role be? Wireless charging solutions enable fast, easy-to-use, and secure charging ecosystems while eliminating the need for cables or precise device alignment. GaN\u00c2\u00a0has a role here as well as in power\u00c2\u00a0electronics\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0radiation-hardened\u00c2\u00a0space\u00c2\u00a0applications,\u00c2\u00a0audio\u00c2\u00a0amplifiers,\u00c2\u00a0and motor control.\u00c2\u00a0But what are the challenges in bringing GaN-based designs to market for these applications, and what other materials\u00c2\u00a0are\u00c2\u00a0competing\u00c2\u00a0with GaN? The efficient storage of electricity, possibly from renewable sources, is now a strategic objective for all companies in the energy sector. This is confirmed by a Zion Market Research study, which shows an annual growth rate for the sector of about 6% over four years. According to the experts, by 2024, the global energy storage market will reach $296 billion in value. Industrial motors\u00c2\u00a0account for\u00c2\u00a030%\u00c2\u00a0of global energy consumption, and the percentage is still rising.\u00c2\u00a0Electric vehicles, meanwhile, are projected to account for\u00c2\u00a05% of global energy consumption by 2040. GaN reduces losses in all these systems. GaN must operate safely and efficiently in a high-frequency ecosystem to fulfill\u00c2\u00a0its role in advancing the\u00c2\u00a0necessary\u00c2\u00a0revolution\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0fast\u00c2\u00a0charging, power\u00c2\u00a0conversion and energy storage. Integrating GaN FET, GaN analog,\u00c2\u00a0and GaN logic\u00c2\u00a0will yield\u00c2\u00a0a true GaN power IC.\u00c2\u00a0Thermal management is\u00c2\u00a0critical\u00c2\u00a0in power electronics,\u00c2\u00a0and high efficiency in higher-power systems is always a focus. With GaN, a 50% reduction in losses can be achieved, reducing the costs and area required to manage heat. In the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAspenCore Guide to Gallium Nitride,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we delve into GaN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0electrical characteristics and how\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0exploit them in power devices. GaN market  For developers adopting wide-bandgap\u00c2\u00a0semiconductors, the market imperatives\u00c2\u00a0are higher device and system\u00c2\u00a0performance, higher efficiency, smaller form factors, and\u00c2\u00a0lower system costs.\u00c2\u00a0GaN is\u00c2\u00a0an important driver of\u00c2\u00a0innovation in power semiconductors, where the material is meeting new performance, efficiency, and system cost requirements. AspenCore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guide looks at the market opportunity for GaN for almost anything that touches the analog world. This covers everything from consumer, industrial, and wireless devices, including 5G, to motor control, automotive, space, data centers, smart energy, and medical applications. The book also covers the major suppliers and supply chain in the GaN ecosystem.

Current growth has mostly come from high-power fast chargers; in fact, during Q2 of 2020, this sector accounted for more than 70% of the total GaN power market, according to market analyst firm Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement. Beyond wireless charging, automotive will fuel the next wave of growth, followed by more adoption in cost-sensitive products for both power and RF applications as volumes grow and cost erosion occurs, and device reliability improves.
