RF experts are sharply divided over whether any of the first batch of devices will support the standard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s millimeter-wave bands. All sides agree that the handsets face a fractured market, with carriers supporting frequencies spanning 600 MHz to 28 GHz, some guarding details of their spectrum plans. As a result, an optimized 5G world phone could be years away. First-generation handsets will probably target specific regions with devices that may be slightly larger or have shorter battery lives than last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LTE models. Price tags may inch up to stay in line with bills of materials estimated to increase 10% to 30% just for RF front-end components. The transition to LTE faced similar problems but not at the scale of 5G, the first cellular standard to support bands at 28 GHz and up. In addition, while many countries will support 5G in 100-MHz swaths in the 3.5-GHz band, that band won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be available in the U.S. until sometime next year. Even then, the U.S. spectrum is expected to be at much smaller bandwidths, less than ideal for 5G. With a lack of new spectrum for 5G in the U.S., T-Mobile is launching a network in a 600-MHz band that it has available while Sprint will use 2.5 GHz. A Verizon representative confirmed that it will use mmWave bands for smartphones next year. The speed and breadth of the changes are taking the art of designing a smartphone to new heights.

Blame carriers in a hurry to recoup spectrum efficiencies from the 5G standard, said Ben Thomas, director of technical marketing at Qorvo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOEMs are under a tremendous amount more pressure than with LTE,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, recalling how Samsung shipped an extra battery with its first LTE phones.
