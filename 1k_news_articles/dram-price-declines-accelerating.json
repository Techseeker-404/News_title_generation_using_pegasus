Wu said PC and server DRAM prices have been particularly soft, growing by only 1-2% in the third quarter. Meanwhile, mobile DRAM pricing has been flat despite the approach of the holiday season, Wu said. Graphics DRAM has also seen prices drop, she added. \u201cOn the other hand, the spot prices have been sliding since the beginning of this year and then dropped to a level lower than contract prices at the end of June,\u201d Wu said. \u201cCurrently, the spot prices are 10% lower than contract prices, which is an early indicator of the possible DRAM price decline in general.\u201d [Partnered Content: How serial flash technology is evolving to meet the new requirements of Industry 4.0 designs]      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
