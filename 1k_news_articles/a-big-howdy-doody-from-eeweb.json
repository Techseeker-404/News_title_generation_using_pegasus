The weather\u2019s fine. Wish you were here.\u201d Seriously, we\u2019d love to have to come over to EEWeb.com and visit us there \u2014 you can stay as long as you like. We have all sorts of interesting articles with which to tease and tempt you; for example, we\u2019ve recently posted some rather cool design and technology-related columns as follows:  Implementing Inductor-less DC/DC Converters With the LM380 Mixed-Signal PCB Design: What Is It? Could This Disrupt the Cellular Infrastructure Industry? Using One Mains Switch to Control Two Lamps The Benefits of HW/SW Co-Simulation for Zynq-Based Designs Webinar: Basics of Motor Control Make Something Awesome with the $99 FPGA-Based Arty Development Board Continuing Experiments with Silego\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GPAK Device  Also, we\u2019ve started something we call the EEWeb Cartoon Punchline Competition featuring two engineers called Bob and Betsy. The idea is that it\u2019s up to you to suggest the caption for the final frame. Here\u2019s the inaugural cartoon from May:  I think the winning caption \u2014 in which Betsy says: \u201cI\u2019m ex-static!\u201d was brilliant (click here to see all the other entries). Just like for the EETimes Cartoon Caption Competition, the winner of the EEWeb Cartoon Punchline Competition receives a full-size, full-color print of the cartoon adorned with their winning caption and signed by the artist. The current (June 2017) Cartoon Punchline Competition is shown below. How do you think Bob should respond to Betsy? (click here to enter).  And I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be surprised to hear that I\u2019ve been providing my own humble contributions, ranging from the subprime to the ridiculous as follows:  I Have an Ocarina and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Not Afraid to Use It Tantalizingly Tasty Turing Tumble Tips and Tricks: Compressing Text Characters Secrets of the Ancients Revealed People-Powered Machines My Future in Space Videos that Amaze and Cheer Father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day Gifts iFixit iPhone Kits Do You Want a Desktop PCB Printer?

Words of Wisdom: There Are No Stupid Engineering Questions Logic Gate Brain Boggler Pong on a Vintage Scope  Phew! It seems like I only arrived at EEWeb a few days ago. Goodness only knows from whence all the above columns came. The main thing is that new content is posted daily, so please do take the time to come and visit us occasionally. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be shy. Sit down, pull up a chair, and say \u201cHoody Doody\u201d by posting a comment or suggesting a punchline for our cartoon competition. I\u2019ll look forward to seeing you there \u2014 just look for the tall, dark, handsome engineer, then keep on looking until you spot the techno-dweeb in the Hawaiian shirt.
