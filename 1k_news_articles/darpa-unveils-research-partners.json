Many others, including Arm and Globalfoundries, will act as subcontractors in the programs officially launched at an event here today. The four projects are part of DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI) expected to receive $1.5 billion over the next five years to drive the U.S. electronics industry forward. They aim to both serve the needs of the U.S. Department of Defense and to boost the semiconductor industry at a time of diminishing returns pursuing Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law to make faster, cheaper, smaller chips.

In addition, researchers from Mentor Graphics and Xilinx recently joined DARPA to help manage ERI programs. The industry participation is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very good start, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all-inclusive, and we want to build on these relationships,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chappell, noting that DARPA plans to announce another handful of programs this fall. In one of the largest of the programs, Skywater Technology Foundry aims to show how it can define a monolithic 3D capability to deliver the equivalent of 7-nm chips using its base 90-nm process. The foundry was formed around a former Cypress fab in Minnesota.   "}
