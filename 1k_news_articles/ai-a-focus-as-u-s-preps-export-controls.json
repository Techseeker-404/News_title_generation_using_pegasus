As part of legislation passed this summer, the U.S. Commerce Department put out a call for input by Dec. 19 on which of 14 broad emerging technologies should face export controls. The call quickly got attention from industry veterans and groups concerned that controls could hurt U.S. companies and worsen a growing tech trade war with China. The call issued on Nov. 14 listed aspects of biotech, AI, quantum computing, semiconductors, robotics, drones, and advanced materials as possible candidates. It gave special attention to AI, listing 10 specific areas ranging from computer vision and natural-language processing to AI chipsets. In semiconductors, it called out even broader areas including microprocessor technology, SoCs, stacked memory on chip, and memory-centric logic. The effort aims to determine which emerging technologies could be strategic to national security and how to identify and control them without \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegatively impacting U.S. leadership in the science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing sectors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It did not define the range of the controls except to say that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat a minimum, it [would] require a license for [their] export \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to countries subject to a U.S. embargo, including those subject to an arms embargo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A government spokesperson said that the Commerce Dept. plans to publish proposed controls on emerging technologies after reviewing comments to its call. It will take public comments on the proposed controls before making them final, but the spokesperson gave no timeline for the process. The Commerce Dept. is expected to issue a second call early next year for guidance on what it calls fundamental or more mature technologies, including semiconductors and manufacturing equipment. The actions stem from the Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Management Act (FIRRMA) aimed to use export controls to stem a perceived leaking of sensitive technologies, especially to China. The bill also expanded the role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Under an 18-month pilot program, CFIUS can now review non-controlling investments in U.S. companies in 27 areas, including semiconductors and semiconductor tools. More than a dozen reactions to the Commerce call are already live on the government\u2019s website, several pointing out the challenges and dangers of the effort. The Association for Computing Machinery is one of multiple groups requesting up to a 60-day extension of the deadline to submit responses due to the effort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cenormous import not only to national security but to the future of American technological progress in industry and academia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe list of technologies that Commerce is considering for controls is so broad that restrictions could severely limit opportunities to participate in international markets, weakening U.S. companies and U.S. competitiveness overall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chris Rowen, a serial entrepreneur in semiconductors, now CEO of BabbleLabs, an AI software startup in Campbell, California. The idea of export controls on AI is \u00e2\u0080\u009canalogous to saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not export software because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used in military systems,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rowen, who is preparing his own response to the government call. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI has become a basic software technique. I would not limit it in sweeping ways \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they need to focus on areas where the majority of use is associated with the military.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
