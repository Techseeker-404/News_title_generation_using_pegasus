As with everything at ST, that transition will pass without any drama, but it is nonetheless a significant development, as it marks the final shift from the old guard that established the chipmaker to younger executives waiting in the wings. Just like Bozotti, the incoming CEO will need to continue stabilizing the company, pushing its growth initiatives in the key automotive and industrial markets and fine-tuning its manufacturing and sales strategies for whatever comes next. The challenges of the next several years will be quite different from the hot potatoes Bozotti juggled in the last five years. Unlike Carlo Ferro, ST\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fiery, long-term CFO and another executive who will today step down from a position he has occupied for more than 10 years, Bozotti is as unassuming as anyone could possibly imagine. His passion for ST runs deep, but in presentations and at other industry events, careful attention is sometimes needed to hear Bozotti speaking in his typical soft undertone. As he takes his bow today, though, Bozotti deserves a notable mention and kudos for assuring ST\u00e2\u0080\u0099s survival. He leaves ST a stronger company on a growth trend and finally sure of its role and direction in the industry. There are numerous challenges still ahead. It must continue to fight to establish a clear leadership position \u00e2\u0080\u0094 preferably No. 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in its core markets, fend off rising competition from equally hungry European and North American rivals, while maintaining a steady foothold in Asia and tackle the perennial problem of finding the right balance between inhouse manufacturing and outsourced production to wafer foundries. On the positive side, ST seems to have figured out the right mix between internally managed sales generation activities and support from electronic component distributors who now account for about one-third of its annual revenue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to be key players in the predictable automotive and industrial markets and we are adding resources in personal electronics, computer peripherals, sensors, PCs and communication equipment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chery said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have strong differentiation in analog and RF. I will push more of our position in these areas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ST is \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d today largely because of Bozotti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nimble management of the company during the most distressing moments in its history. ST grew strongly in the early years of Bozotti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stewardship with yearly sales peaking in 2010 at $10.3 billion from $8.9 billion in 2005, the year he assumed the position of CEO.   Waves of problems in the wireless handset market followed, shaving billions of dollars from ST\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sales, which sank to $6.7 billion in 2015. The main culprits were its biggest customers in the wireless handset market, including Nokia, which at one time accounted for as much as 22.4 percent of sales in 2005. This percentage began dropping as Nokia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortunes eroded and crashed by 2012 to less than 10 percent of annual revenue. Nokia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sale of its handset business to Microsoft ended the relationship between the two companies. ST has been struggling to climb out of that mess since. Does Bozotti share in the blames for that period in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history? Possibly. ST\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior management didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t foresee the market changes that would eventually sweep away their biggest customers. Even when the reality sank in as Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iPhones came to dominate the market, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much ST could do to immediately replace almost $2 billion in lost sales. It had to regroup, refocus on other market sectors, push for increased sales from distribution to diversify revenue and take a strategic decision to limit exposure to any single customer in future. Those efforts have yielded positive results. Hence this tribute to Bozotti as he leaves the ST stage where he has worked \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by his own count \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor 41 years and 4 months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
