The processor, called GAP8, is built on the RISC-V and PULP open-source projects. Greenwaves\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first sample chip just came back last week from TSMC, which built it using its 55nm low power process. With this brainchild in hand, the company is pitching its GAP8 processor and GAP8 software development kit this week both at Mobile World Congress here and Embedded World in N\u00c3\u00bcrnberg, Germany. Mike Demler, senior analyst at the Linley Group, told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen someone add a neural engine to an MCU-class processor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The move by the French startup illustrates how the AI frenzy is infecting even the IoT world, where most edge devices are both resource- and power-constrained.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 Founded in 2014, Greenwaves didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t originally aim to design embedded AI processors. The initial goal, to do an innovative orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) algorithm known as GreenOFDM on a processor, however, recently shifted focus. The company reset its sights on machine learning applications, acknowledged Lo\u00c3\u00afc Li\u00c3\u00a9tar, co-founder and CEO of GreenWaves. This pivot became inevitable, explained Li\u00c3\u00a9tar, when he saw \u00e2\u0080\u009cfar more [market] traction\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the processor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to do \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontent understanding (image, sound, vibration).\u00e2\u0080\u009d GreenWaves was born when two projects merged into one. Li\u00c3\u00a9tar was originally interested in solving the high-power consumption limits of OFDM and was looking for an appropriate processor architecture to map his algorithm. Eric Flamand, Li\u00c3\u00a9tar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-time friend and now GreenWaves\u00e2\u0080\u0099 CTO, was then developing an ultra-low power processor for content understanding. After the two decided to join forces as a single startup, they leveraged Flamand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PULP-based architecture to offer both machine learning functions and GreenOFDM. Asked about whatever happened to GreenOFDM, Li\u00c3\u00a9tar noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA couple of customers are interested in the SW modem capabilities of GAP8, albeit not for GreenOFDM, which would require the development of a specific power amplifier to deliver on its promise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Architecture  Put simply, GreenWaves\u00e2\u0080\u0099 GAP8 consists of nine RISC-V cores. One serves as a fabric controller managing peripherals and communication with the outside world. The other eight cores are organized in a cluster with shared data and instruction memory. The cluster\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 consisting of eight RISC-V cores \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has an integrated hardware convolution computation engine that accelerates inference calculations for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). According to Greenwaves, the fabric controller and cluster live in separate voltage and frequency domains, so that each consumes power only when necessary. Greenwaves also used the standard RISC-V ISA extension mechanism to add instructions that boost performance for DSP-centric operations, which are frequently found in the algorithms executed on the cluster. GAP8 Architecture (Source: Greenwaves)   Li\u00c3\u00a9tar explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor most developers, GAP8 is programmed just like any MCU.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When compute-intense tasks need to be launched, they go to the cluster through the APIs of a rich compute library included in the GAP8 SDK. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA tool-driven methodology also allows trained CNNs described with an AI framework to be optimized for and ported onto GAP8,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.
