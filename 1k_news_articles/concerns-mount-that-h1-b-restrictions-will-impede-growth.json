The H1-B category is typically used for experienced workers in the high technology sector and L1 for foreign executives. The blockade will also be extended to the granting process of green cards, which allow permanent residence in the country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cH1-B visas are a method by which high tech companies in the United States are able to attract talent from overseas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chris Dries, CEO at UnitedSiC. He continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then eventually, many of those people become permanent residents and often US citizens. The current administration took an approach during the pandemic period which states that with such a high level of unemployment in the United States, they do not want to offer that opportunity for foreign nationals in the high tech sector, which has always been a lifeline for our labor because there simply not enough people in highly specialized fields such as ours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d UnitedSiC is composed of engineers from 16 different countries, and most of them arrived through the H1-B visa program. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur companies throughout the high tech sector have often come from this pool, if you take a look at the CEO of Google, for example, he was born in India and came through the same immigration process, Sergei Brin came here with his parents from Russia and helped found Google,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chris. The changes in policy come as UnitedSiC is preparing to plan for the future between now and the next 3-4 years where a complete recovery in the automotive sector is expected. \u201cIn the meantime, we are having a lot of success in the area of IT infrastructure and renewable energy and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing all we can to mitigate the effects of the new restrictions on our team and ensure a funnel of talent,\u201d said Chris. He continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is vital as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at a moment of notable growth. We had our largest commercial month ever, in the month of June, which is pretty incredible in the midst of a global pandemic. And so it\u2019s really exciting as the whole work from home thing is actually driving growth in the data center segment that we feed into with diodes for PFC and now increasingly 650 volt FETs for totem-pole power factor correction, and other DC to DC conversion. We\u2019re living in kind of a bizarre world with the NASDAQ spinning off all-time highs, yet there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s massive unemployment here in the United States, but everybody\u2019s working from home and it\u2019s driving an important part of our business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chris Dries, CEO and president of United SiC The strong market momentum of inverter companies developing SiC solutions for the automotive market is expected to quickly drive SiC device revenues above the $1 billion thresholds by 2024. Of course, American companies hope to participate in that growth, and of course that will require increased staffing, and that\u2019s why they are so concerned about the H1-B visa restrictions. In 2019 SiC became a key factor in many growth markets such as electric vehicles, battery chargers, and IT infrastructure. SiC has seen the production capacity of many companies grow by offering increasingly efficient products.\u00c2\u00a0UnitedSiC\u00c2\u00a0has Delivered 14 new SiC FET products with Industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lowest RDS(on) at <10m\u00ce\u00a9FETs and high-performance 4-lead kelvin package. SiC FETs are a major contributor to performance and reliability improvements, with overall system cost reduction in next-generation data centres. UnitedSiC is focusing on some main areas such as automotive traction inverters, onboard chargers, DC-to-DC converters. The interest in solutions with lower Rds(on) is a strong demand from the market. SiC can withstand higher temperatures and has a thermal conductivity which is about 3.5 times better than Si to support high-temperature operation with high voltage and power levels. \u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
