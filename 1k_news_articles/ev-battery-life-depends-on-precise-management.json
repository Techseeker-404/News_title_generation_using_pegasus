Electric vehicles (EVs) commonly rely on multiple batteries that must be balanced to achieve maximum battery efficiency. The new TI part will be critical for battery management systems in EVs. EVs simply perform better than traditional vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines. Electric motors are characterized by greater efficiency, and deliver excellent performance. These motors make it possible to considerably simplify the mechanical design of vehicles as well, by drastically eliminating the noise level and polluting emissions. Electric vehicles have disadvantages too, however, and many of them are directly related to batteries and battery management. They include range limitations and long recharging times which result from the technology currently used in electrical energy storage systems. EVs and hybrid (HEV) vehicles, in which currents and voltages are generated with very high values, also must comply with the most rigorous safety standards, ensuring that any failure or damage to the electronic components onboard the vehicle does not create a risk for the occupants of the vehicle. One of the main features of the new e-vehicles is that they can be easily recharged from an external power source. This distinguishes them from hybrid electric vehicles, which integrate an internal combustion engine with the battery but cannot be connected to an electrical source. There are two basic types of electric vehicles: all-electric vehicles (AEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). AEVs work only with electricity and are controlled by one or more electric motors and rely entirely on electricity from properly recharged batteries. They do not consume fuel and do not produce exhaust emissions. They include battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). In addition to recharging from the electricity grid, both types are loaded in part by regenerative braking, which taps part of the energy normally lost during braking (or by using other sources). \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, I think that the sunlight is the most efficient energy that can be used to charge systems in these vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as said Ivo Marocco, the director of business development and functional safety, battery automotive products for EV/HEV at Texas Instruments. Electric vehicle manufacturers choose batteries that are optimized for durability rather than high specific energy; these batteries are larger and heavier than those used in consumer electronics. The use of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles is pushing the industry to study how to increase their duration, and at the same time, experts have begun to analyze the causes of breakdowns and natural deterioration. Nonetheless, they are still the main option for EV storage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey offer the highest possible energy density with the minimum amount of weight and space,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ivo. Lithium-ion batteries required several years of theoretical and experimental study before being marketed, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t cause for further investigation. Researchers are addressing challenges in improving power density, durability, costs, charging time, and safety. The management of the charge level will make heat management efficient, with fast and effective heat exchange systems, avoiding explosions or deformations. The rapid adoption of this technology is the basis of unprecedented design activities in the automotive sector, as manufacturers are committed to increasing market share in the growing markets for electric and hybrid vehicles. Performance monitoring is the key to the success of Li-Ion applications: in addition to calculating the accumulation of energy as an operating metric, this function guarantees long battery life avoiding situations that could damage the cells. The BMS manages rechargeable batteries (individual cells or entire battery packs), to protect the storage system by determining a Safe Operating Area, i.e., a safety area within which the battery pack, and therefore the individual cells, ensure the best technical performance and durability. The BMS is a system for complete control of the battery pack of an EV vehicle with cell array management and all the diagnostic and safety functions for the management of high voltage onboard the vehicle and the cell program balancing. Another important function of the BMS system for Li-Ion technology is the balancing of the cells, which makes it possible to compensate for any slight discrepancies among them to optimize the life of the battery pack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe battery management system has the goal to measure the voltage across the cells in the back accurately and then reliably report them. Essentially, those are the two major tasks that a battery management system for a type of vehicle like this is called to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ivo. The BMS also has the task of monitoring the operating conditions of the battery to ensure operation within certain limits of voltage and temperature. It also carries out the task of estimating the state of charge (SOC State-of-Charge) in the dual purpose to provide information on the charge available to the charging systems and to the device using the stored energy and to be able to carry out the balancing. In addition, the BMS performs the estimation of the state of health of the batteries (SOH State-of-Health) to determine the residual life of the cells inside the battery. The Texas Instruments BQ79606A-Q1 provides simultaneous, high-precision measurements for three to six battery cells. The device can support the large stack configurations present in battery packs for automotive applications. Providing a delta-sigma ADC converter for cell input, the BQ79606A-Q1 allows the simultaneous measurement of battery voltages. The battery packs exploit the potentials of the cells and transmit the signals to the data acquisition section of the BMS system. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the things that this device does is aligning synchronization and making so there is a possibility to delay the start of your ADC conversion and align all the cells so that voltage measurement is synchronous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Ivo. The new device includes other auxiliary acquisition systems for temperature verification by 6 NTC and internal guides to allow safety checks for the device. An ADC mold temperature measurement is also included to provide temperature correction to enable high precision results over an extended temperature range. The BQ79606EVM board allows evaluating the performance of the BQ79606A-Q1. \u00a0  \u00a0 Figure 1: Functional block diagram of BQ79606A-Q1 \u00a0  \u00a0 Figure 2: BQ79606EVM Evaluation Board The main challenges on a design basis are represented by the risks of high voltage and the hot-plug features of the BMS data acquisition circuit, where it may also be necessary to measure hundreds of potentials of the cells connected in series. The arrangement of the battery cells is particularly important as size, weight, and above all costs have implications not only for vehicle maintenance but also for the related market. The solutions organized in modules help to distribute the weight, as well as offering practicality and ease of management. The dimensions of the modules must be studied specifically, considering that they are in proportion to the cost and complexity of the wiring. Modular battery packs may include a microprocessor to control the data acquisition process as well as a reliable communication interface.      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
