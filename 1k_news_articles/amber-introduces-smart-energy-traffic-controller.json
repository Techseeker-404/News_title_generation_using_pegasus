Leveraging intelligent solid-state technology, Amber\u2019s solution will ensure the intelligent selection of renewable energy sources, optimizing efficiency. In an interview with EE Times, Thar Casey, CEO of Amber, explained how the new solution will enable on-the-fly switching of building electricity sources to maintain energy efficiency while saving money. Casey said the small footprint device would be installed next to the switch box to allow for easy integration. The device would offer data processing while optimizing costs and energy stability depending on peak hours and load.\u00c2\u00a0\u201cAmber\u2019s Energy Traffic Controller enables bi-directional current regulation to manage multiple simultaneous input sources. A cloud-integrated intelligent data controller evaluates the best energy source based on the data available from each source, such as the current cost of grid power and current usage demand,\u201d said Casey. Smart Management For more than a century, electricity has been supplied mainly by large power plants, which produce it using fossil fuels, nuclear energy, or hydroelectric power, responsible for 40% of global CO2 emissions. These power plants continuously distribute huge amounts of energy to users, keeping a centralized control and constant flow. Energy consumption worldwide is steadily increasing, with a strong demand for alternative ways of supplying energy through new energy sources such as solar, wind and even forms of electrical storage. Awareness of environmental protection has increased, bringing governments and private citizens closer to renewable energies, such as solar energy, for powering buildings, thus increasing the installation of photovoltaic systems, which have a variable output by nature. The huge growth in renewables requires electricity grids to adopt digital communication technologies that can provide the necessary flexibility for users and utilities. The great attraction for alternative forms of energy is driven by money-saving. The interaction between various energy sources allows consumers to manage various peaks in demand and at the same time resell energy in low-load situations. This interaction between these various energy sources and the home is crucial for managing energy demand and use at both the micro and macro level. At the micro-level, a consumer will use alternative forms to power his or her home. At the macro level, a consumer will use alternative forms of energy to feed energy into the grid in a smart grid vision. Electricity grids today need to be flexible enough to accommodate any peaks in renewable generation (e.g. in the middle of the summer months) and, at the same time, ensure that the whole electricity system does not collapse at times of lower generation. The alternative is to use the capacity of the existing grid in a more efficient, smarter, \u2018smart\u2019 way. Through this new approach to the electricity grid, new ways of managing, controlling and protecting it can be introduced to ensure better capacity for integrating large amounts of electricity, improving the level of security and reliability of the entire system and implementing procedures for load control and active involvement of end customers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the near future, solid-state electrification with embedded intelligence will enable building owners to have seamless and intelligent control over electrical power source, efficiency, and affordability decisions, previously outside their hands and only possible at the macro-grid level with the Utilities.\u00c2\u00a0 While such enhancement and innovation is occurring at the micro-grid level,\u00c2\u00a0 the impact and value will be felt across the macro-grid landscape. \u00c2\u00a0As this new autonomous control of the micro-grid in buildings, the smart building grid becomes more and more prevalent, it will have a cumulative upstream effect on the macro utility grid, enabling greater energy stability and efficiencies across the broader electrical landscape,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Casey. Figure 1: Smart Home where all is connected Amber Controller The expansion of distributed generation from renewable sources and the spread of new installations, even in households, has led to a radical change in energy distribution. Synchronization between power sources makes it possible to use several energy sources simultaneously. The electricity grid is no longer just a channel for transmitting and distributing electricity from large power plants to end customers but becomes a \u201cSmart Grid.\u201d The Smart Grid is an intelligent network capable of accommodating two-way energy flows, allowing producers and consumers to interact, determining consumption demands in advance, and flexibly adapting electricity production and consumption. A network capable of communicating by exchanging information on energy flows, managing peak demand more efficiently, avoiding power cuts, and reducing load where necessary. Amber Energy Traffic Controller is able to extract a percentage of its power from solar, a percentage of its power from a battery, and from the grid, defining a dynamic decision process that recognizes the quality of the energy coming from these different sources. The controller weights all the sources, automatically recognizing the optimum percentage that should be drawn to support the building\u2019s demand. Casey said how the new device, together with the full range of devices offered by Amber, allows buildings to be automated and optimized directly from the grid. The combination of sensors and IoT functions will make the building smarter by offering autonomous decision-making and control. Figure 2: Amber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Energy Controller \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Energy Traffic Controller will intelligently and automatically switch, or combine, power from solar, wind, home batteries, liquid fuel generators, and grid sources, all on the fly, for optimal efficiency and cost.\u00c2\u00a0 Whether a retrofit to existing buildings or installed in new buildings, the Amber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controller will sit alongside the existing circuit breaker panel, yet at a fraction of that panel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size. Plus, when complemented by Amber-powered outlets and switches throughout the building, it provides whole building energy awareness and insights. It is a design example of how Amber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breakthroughs change the intelligence embedded in building electrical grids and thereby transforming the value this infrastructure delivers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Casey. Spikes in demand create huge strains on the grid, especially at certain times of the day. The Amber Energy Traffic Controller is able to significantly mitigate these peaks by aggregating various data, thus guiding the network towards a better decision. This dynamic embedded machine-learning intelligence is similar to how the concept of autonomous vehicles works, Casey explained. Each vehicle is able to assess the road around it, but also understand what other vehicles intend to do before they do it. The speed at which information is processed and acted upon is almost instantaneous and almost imperceptible to the person in the car. At the same level, through a proactive understanding of demand and recognition of energy sources at the building level, other buildings on the same network will be able to understand and react accordingly. This digital awareness will mitigate fluctuations in peak demand and also energy quality in an increasingly green future where energy efficiency and the reduction of polluting compounds will be important.
