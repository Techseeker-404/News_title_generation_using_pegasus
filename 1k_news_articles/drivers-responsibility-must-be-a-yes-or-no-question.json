According to Level 3 definitions, it\u2019s hard to tell. That there is still no definitive answer to the question is seriously troubling, and so the debate over SAE Level 3 is flaring back up. The controversy is not about the nuts and bolts in the SAE J3016 technical standard put together by SAE International. Instead, the spotlight shines on a broad spectrum of interpretations and loose claims that automakers and tech suppliers are conjuring as they call their new vehicles the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLevel 3 of Driving Automation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The debate within the industry spilled into the public arena with Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent admission that neither Autopilot nor Full Self-Driving (FSD) will be autonomous systems, an admission that set off an enormous tweet storm. This acknowledgement emerged when a Freedom of Information Act petition led to the release of an email thread between Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team and the California Dept. of Motor Vehicles. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team told the DMV late last year that its \u00e2\u0080\u0098Autosteer on City Streets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feature \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinues to firmly root the vehicle in SAE Level 2 capability and does not make it autonomous under the DMV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Forget all Elon Musk\u2019s bravado on FSD; Tesla is now confessing that its vehicle is still looking up at Level 3. This was especially jarring, given that Tesla offered its customers a Full Self-Driving option \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a $10,000 option you can pre-pay for for your Tesla, leading consumers to believe that their brand new Tesla would eventually live up to its \u00e2\u0080\u009cself-driving\u00e2\u0080\u009d descriptive. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Honda surprised the global auto market by launching Honda Sensing Elite, an enhanced version of its advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS). The Japanese company called it \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first commercially available SAE Level 3 system\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the world, although the car itself is an extremely limited edition available only in Japan. Over the last several years, auto industry observers and human-machine interface (HMI) specialists have voiced concerns over Level 3. The growing consensus is that automakers might do well to skip Level 3 altogether, due to vehicle-to-human-driver handover issues that have defied solution.

(Source: SAE International) Phil Koopman, co-founder of Edge Case Research and professor at Carnegie Mellon University, is skeptical about Level 3, but isn\u2019t dismissing it yet, either. In opening remarks at the Roadmap to Next-gen EV&AV conference last week, Koopman stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u2019m not saying Level 3 shouldn\u2019t happen, but I\u2019m saying you can\u2019t communicate what Level 3 is to average drivers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful to them. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge problem. In his view, SAE J3016 is an \u00e2\u0080\u009cengineering standard by engineers and for engineers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For \u00e2\u0080\u009cordinary audiences, you need a different framework\u00e2\u0080\u009d for driving safety, Koopman insists. He recently proposed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cUser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide to Vehicle Automation Modes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposing four categories of vehicle operation: Assistive, Supervised, Automated, and Autonomous. User\u2019s Guide to Vehicle Automation Modes. Click the above to enlarge. (Source: Edge Case Research) During his speech at the virtual event, Koopman explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the Assistive mode, the human role is traditional driving. The human takes care of driving safety\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The next mode is the Supervised mode in which the humans are responsible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not for driving since the car does the actual driving task. But the human driver is responsible for driving safety. And that means eyes on the road.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He explained that these two modes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Assistive and Supervised \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are driver assistance. An \u00e2\u0080\u009cimportant line is crossed\u00e2\u0080\u009d when entering automated mode in which human drivers \u00e2\u0080\u009care allowed to take eyes off the road because the car is entirely responsible for both driving and driving safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d EE Times asked Koopman why his four modes exclude a Level 3 equivalent. Phil Koopman He explained that although the SAE levels are well-defined, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a challenge even for people knowledgeable about safety and driving to digest what exactly the standard says \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that\u2019s before getting to the footnotes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI struggled with it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Koopman acknowledged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u2019t see how someone without a lot of expertise who hasn\u2019t even read the standard has any chance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Second, he noted, Level 3 poses a distinction based on \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich functions belong to the car and which functions to the driver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is a proven recipe for confusion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom a driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view, you still have to pay attention in Level 3. So, a driver would be hard pressed to tell the difference between Level 2 and Level 3, because some failures count, and some don\u2019t. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a technical distinction that I\u2019m not even sure I could tell which one [that belongs to the driver].\u00e2\u0080\u009d Level 3 doesn\u2019t go away, stressed Koopman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what you have to do is to ask if the driver is responsible for safety. It\u2019s a yes/no question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his opinion, there are assumptions made in Level 3 that in practice are so nebulous as to be useless, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u2019re responsible for safety, except when you\u2019re not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen you\u2019re not responsible depends on your understanding of the engineering details of your particular car.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such distinctions are guaranteed to be unhelpful to human drivers.

How regulators eventually deal with Level 3 remains to be seen. While J3016 defines matters clearly for engineers, Koopman said that if regulators don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the standard exactly says, they might formulate regulations that contradict standards, or allow standards that materially override the regulations. He reminded that he is not talking about any particular regulation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you want to say Level 3, you have to buy into the standard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After all, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe standard includes that the driver might need to take over control with zero warning time. And [with] no notice from the Automated Driving Systems, you\u2019re supposed to just notice the cars are doing something weird, and you must intervene.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Undoubtedly, Level 3 is subject to interpretation. But the standard itself is quite clear, noted Koopman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem is that very few people talk about what\u2019s actually in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d People know what they want in Level 3. Many think they know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different from what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou actually have to read the standard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The point is that the driver needs to know, whether he or she is supposed to pay attention. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u2019s a yes/ no question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Koopman reiterated. Regulations or vendors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 manuals might say Mr. Driver, you can take your eyes off the road. But when you do, look out, because \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u2019re going to blame you for taking your eyes off the road if there\u2019s a crash.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Koopman said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that\u2019s what it says. But my understanding is it\u2019s an issue that has not quite settled yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bottom line: You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have it both ways. If paying attention is optional, then blaming an inattentive driver for an accident is an untenable option. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that\u2019s not a system I\u2019d be happy to see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Koopman.
