It is also reshuffling the electronics supply chain with new options and new players for how and where to integrate this new intelligence. The issues will be the focus of an expanded smart automotive program at Semicon West. Beyond automated driving, AI will soon monitor the driver. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA front-facing camera can discern where the driver is looking or, more importantly, where the driver is not looking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tim Wong, one of the session\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speakers and a technical marketing manager for autonomous vehicles at Nvidia. Even when humans are driving, autonomous vehicle sensors and systems still serve as a warning system for human drivers, preventing them entering an intersection if they detect a car about to run a red light.\u00c2\u00a0 The system will also learn to predict driver preferences, adjusting the seat and mirrors for different drivers, or the radio and windows for different temperatures or times of day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more to intelligence than just lane keeping and emergency braking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wong noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some key little driving features that will likely really accelerate adoption, such as automated driving through heavy traffic, and errand assist, where the car will circle around to wait for you while you run inside for a few minutes to get something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The economics of AI will drive the automotive sector toward higher use of each vehicle to absorb the costs. It will enable 24/7 applications like ride hailing and shared vans, said Mohammad Musa, CEO and co-founder of Deepen AI, another program speaker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe number of vehicles sold may decrease, so the industry economics will shift from how many cars are sold to how many miles are driven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Musa said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe basics of valuation and life cycle will change, as the key issues become how reliable the car is in heavy usage, how much maintenance is required, how good the battery is and how long the car will last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The automotive supply chain also is evolving. For example, Nvidia now supplies platforms and software to 370 automotive customers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sensor ecosystem is changing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wong, noting that as many as a hundred separate controllers such as engine and tire pressure subsystems are being consolidated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutomakers are now putting all the intelligence in a single compute platform, using a mixture of smart and dumb sensors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added Cameras can sense a driver's intention or lack of attention. Images: Nvidia.  Data sets for AI training are a key requirement for creating these systems. Curated data sets with highly accurate labels are even more valuable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the reason many companies are safeguarding this data as a competitive advantage. Wong says that he would like to see the industry share more data, with the goal of improving the overall safety of all autonomous vehicles. AI software startups can help ease the complicated task of applying deep learning to automated driving. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur goal is to provide AI tools to speed the development of autonomous vision systems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Musa of Deepen AI. The software startup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first product simplifies the labeling of objects in vision systems, enabling them to better recognize, track and predict behavior of cars and pedestrians in a 3D world. \u00c2\u00a0Still, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit may not ever be economical and practical for a car to be safely autonomous everywhere, under every condition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cElectrification and autonomy go hand in hand, as the compute power required for autonomous capabilities requires the energy and infrastructure only found in electric vehicles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Steven Atneosen, vice president of corporate development of XPT, a division of the emerging Chinese electric smart car maker NIO, another event speaker. China mandated that 12 percent of cars sold in 2020 be new-energy vehicles. The government also is committed to expand the charging infrastructure to meet the ramp in sales, he added.\u00c2\u00a0 \u2014 Paula Doe is a director of technology for the SEMI trade group  "}
