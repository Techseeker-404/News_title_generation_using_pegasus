So while the PC connected to the network might have traditionally been the point at which security was enabled, the trust anchors now need to be located down at the hardware level, in silicon, and as close to the edge as possible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even in the sensors.    AspenCore Media has explored The Day When the Industrial IoT Gets Hacked. Included in this Special Project are: Designers\u2019 Guide to IIoT Security, Embedded Security at the Edge, and What Makes IIoT So Vulnerable to Cyberattacks.   In the following pages, we will offer you the lay of the land for IIoT security solutions. First, we start with the chip level, where there are several options. Infineon  Infineon provides the OPTIGA family of hardware security controllers with software containing the cryptographic keys and certificates, plus the drivers and software libraries. It enables engineers to integrate security into their systems. For simple authentication, the Trust B product is used for IoT edge devices and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdumb\u00e2\u0080\u009d sensors that simply supply information; the device supports smaller cryptographic key sizes that might be used for authenticating a spare part or a battery, for example. Trust E addresses the security requirements of devices that are more feature-rich and need a higher level of security; it is a turnkey solution with OS, Applet, and complete host-side integration support and up to 3-kB memory. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main solution for high-end security for industrial automation is the OPTIGA Trust X.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a discrete hardware security module built on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with 256-bit, AES128, and secure hash algorithms (SHA)-256 encryption. It enables functions like mutual authentication, secured communication, data store protection, lifecycle management, secured updates, and platform integrity protection and has up to 10-kB user memory.
