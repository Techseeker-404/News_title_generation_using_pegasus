To that end, Anritsu and Qualcomm have combined to create a 5G NR standalone connection between an Anritsu MT8000A Radio Communications Test Set and a handheld device that uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon X50 5G modem.    5G standalone connections don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely on LTE technology such as modulation or protocols. Figure 1 shows the difference between standalone and non-standalone connections. The tests were conducted in both the FR1 band (below 6 GHz) and the FR2 mmWave band (24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz).    Figure 1: 5G standalone links don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely on LTE technology, instead using 5G NR. (Source: Anritsu)     Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handheld device (Figure 2) lets engineers move around to test the link. According to Qualcomm, \u00e2\u0080\u009c5G mobility is a focus area for Qualcomm, so we have been shrinking our early large-scale prototype systems into a form-factor mobile test device to allow for commercial smartphones expected to launch in the first half of 2019.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     "}
