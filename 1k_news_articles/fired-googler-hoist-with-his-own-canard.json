But the news hit close to home for me.  I found in this little tirade an indisputable attack on women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability (or lack thereof) to do science, engineering and coding. Naturally, I was offended. But I decided to weigh in on this topic now \u00e2\u0080\u0093 after so much ink was already spilled \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not because I was compelled to defend my gender. What actually fascinates me is that this so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiversity\u00e2\u0080\u009d memo offers such fertile ground to debate many issues at so many levels. They include the eternal controversy over \u00e2\u0080\u009cbiological differences between men and women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d accusations about the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitically correct monoculture at Google,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an examination of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreedom of speech for employees at corporations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reported plan to take legal action against Google. Job as an Engineer The final straw, inspiring me to speak up was\u00c2\u00a0an essay written by Yonatan Zunger, who nailed the manifesto-writing Googler for not knowing his job as an engineer. Zunger, who served as Distinguished Engineer on Privacy at Google until recently, defined his engineering mission as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot the art of building devices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the art of fixing problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pointing out that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevices are a means, not an end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zunger wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFixing problems means first of all understanding them\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aand since the whole purpose of the things we do is to fix problems in the outside world, problems involving people, that means that understanding people, and the ways in which they will interact with your system, is fundamental to every step of building a system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In short, the point was that if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand women as users of your system and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have women in your engineering team, how can you, Mr. Engineer, fix problems and build your system that speak to the entire outside world (more than half of which is women)? \u2018Echo Chamber\u2019 Debate Read carefully the offending blog, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ideological Echo Chamber,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you find that the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central grievance is political bias on Google management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part that proscribes Googlers from an \u00e2\u0080\u009copen and honest discussions\u00e2\u0080\u009d on diversity issues. The author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0full manifesto can be read here. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accept the guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premise and believe that a hunger for intelligent discourse motivated him to cry out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099accuse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, even a casual reader has no difficulty discerning a predisposition that might be called sexism, especially when he writes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmen and women biologically differ in many ways,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an anodyne observation that he twists into a justification for \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All engineers are equal, in other words, but some engineers are more equal than girl engineers. Of course, the memo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s author, James Damore, 28, with a Harvard degree in systems biology, offered literally no foundation for the congenital engineering deficit in the female of the species. After Google fired Damore this week, the case got even weirder. Predictably, the political right seized the moment and declared Damore a martyr. In their narrative, Damore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career got squashed by proponents of what they call \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical correctness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Excuse me if I forego any attempt to define \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical correctness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a phrase so overused by now that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningless. Freedom of Speech Under the current divisive political climate, a backlash was inevitable. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misguided to use Damore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blurt as a serious freedom-of-speech issue. Note first that virtually every U.S. corporation insists on being an \u00e2\u0080\u009cat will\u00e2\u0080\u009d employer. Hence, anyone who believes that the company exists to protect his or her First Amendment rights is smoking dope on company time. Any employee who uses the\u00c2\u00a0 corporation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s computers and corporate e-mail systems to publish controversial personal views \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially the kind that go viral and offend powerful interest groups \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is risking a pink slip. The best argument I found on this issue was a\u00c2\u00a0story on Business Insider. The story made it clear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe First Amendment protects Americans\u2019 free-speech rights from being restricted by the government, not their employer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This piece also discussed that Damore was most likely employed in California, which has a law uniquely sympathetic to political rights for workers. But even in California, Damore has an uphill fight, it said. Women thing As I read the whole manifesto by Damore, the most disconcerting passages focused on his warped grasp of biology, leading to a series on conclusions that no repurtable biologist would endorse. He writes: On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just socially constructed because: \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re universal across human cultures \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The underlying traits are highly heritable \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective \u00c2\u00a0Next page:\u00c2\u00a0Think Jackie Robinson     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
