The total capital raised to date is $188 million. Superman vision At the time Raviv Melamed, Naftali Chayat, and Miri Ratner founded Vayyar, their ambition was to develop an alternative for breast cancer detection, using RF to quickly and affordably look into human tissue and detect malignant growth. Eight years later, their 4D imaging sensor goes beyond the medical sphere to serve a myriad of markets. Vayyar claims it has designed a small, sensor-based chip that, with its 72 transmitters and 72 receivers, tracks and maps everything without a camera. It detects obstacles and monitors people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location, movement, height, posture and vital signs wirelessly, in all lighting and weather conditions, and in real time. A key differentiator is its ability to \u00e2\u0080\u009csee\u00e2\u0080\u009d through walls, closed doors, and other solid objects, the company said. And because Vayyar uses radio frequency waves to detect objects -unlike other products that rely on cameras and optics- its sensors do not collect any optic data, protecting users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 privacy. A, B, C, D In 2017, the Israeli company closed a $45 million Series C financing round co-led by Walden Riverwook and ITI with additional funding from Claltech, Battery Ventures, Bessemer Ventures, Israel Cleantech Ventures and Amiti. Two years later, EE Times asked Vayyar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s co-founder and CEO Raviv Melamed what the financing made possible. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Series C funding was used to further develop our core technology, including the launch of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most advanced 4D (3D+motion) radar imaging sensor, which now serves as the basis for our products,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdditionally, we were able to expand our focus to create customized solutions for more vertical markets and expand geographically beyond the U.S. with a focus on Asia and Europe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The funds also served to further build out Vayyar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s B2C business and launch more products, including its own line of consumer products under the Walabot brand. SPONSORED: Strong industrial security with the IEC 62443 standard | Learn more The new $109 million investment, led Koch Disruptive Technologies, the venture arm of Koch Industries, aims to give Vayyar the scale and efficiencies it needs to develop its 4D radar imaging technology. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur plan is to deepen our capabilities in our three core markets -automotive, retail and smart home- while providing new solutions in some secondary markets such as homeland security, robotics, and testing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Melamed said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also plan to expand our global footprint by opening new offices and growing our teams around the globe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Automotive, retail and smart home Today, Vayyar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary markets are automotive, retail and smart home, but the ambition is to rapidly expand in other areas of growth. In the automotive domain, Vayyar claims its chip enables in-cabin passenger location and classification, occupant size, vital sign and posture analysis, as well as 360\u00c2\u00b0 exterior mapping, including monitoring cars, objects and pedestrians around a vehicle. Melamed commented: \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe offer an in-cabin solution that can monitor passengers in a vehicle and alert when these appears to be an issue -we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a lot of demand for this type of technology when it comes to babies accidentally being left in cars with dire consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  (Image: Vayyar Imaging Ltd.)   At last year\u2019s Paris Motor Show, French automotive supplier Valeo indeed announced it was integrating Vayyar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radar sensors with its products to monitor infants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 breathing and trigger an alert in case of emergency. This includes cases when an infant has been left inside a vehicle alone. Companies then said they would work together toward mass production readiness to change the standard of safety in the automotive industry. In the retail sector, Melamed noted, Vayyar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sensor technology is used to track and map everything happening within stores, to measure conversion rates and inventory levels, as well as provide e-commerce analytics for brick-and-mortar shops. Because falls are a major health risk for older people, Vayyar is also providing systems that track seniors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activity patterns, identify when a fall occurs and generate an alert for help, and predict health deterioration to enable early assistance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur technology is used both for seniors living at home as well as in senior living and hospital facilities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked about the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term vision, Melamed said the goal is to provide \u00e2\u0080\u009caffordable 4D radar imaging sensors that will positively impact people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everyday lives in different industries such as elderly care, automotive safety and experience, homeland security, and medical.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In terms of collaborations, Melamed said Vayyar is currently working with SoftBank, Valeo Faurecia, Brose, \u00e2\u0080\u009calong with several exciting premier and Tier-1 brands that we hope to announce in 2020.\u00e2\u0080\u009d      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
