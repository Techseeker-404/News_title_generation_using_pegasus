Imagine a realtor being able to film and distribute an immersive 3D tour of a home for her clients to explore, or Dad finally having the ability to capture and share your family trips in exhaustive 3D glory. Imagine video games that integrate real terrain with computer generated characters and effects that realistically interact with their environment. There are several different commercially available techniques for providing z-axis or depth information. They include traditional stereo cameras with two lenses, as well as more advanced approaches using structured light or time-of-flight. Each has its own strengths and weakness, including the physical size of the module, accuracy of the depth information, the ability to provide depth information in different lighting conditions, and of course cost. Today, thanks to advanced signal processing, 3D cameras are able to interpret and represent 3D imagery even better than humans, enabling some pretty compelling applications\u2013including biometric security. A front-facing 3D camera allows the device\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owner to simply look at the screen to unlock it. Face-recognition authentication has gotten a bad rap in the past, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to emphasize that this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s facial recognition technology. Mathematically precise depth perception technology means that a picture, video, or even a mask of your face won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to unlock it\u00e2\u0080\u0094it needs to be the real thing. [Sponsored Authentication Flash: Closing the Security Gap]  Just like you can tell the difference between your friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face and a picture of her face, so today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3D facial recognition technology can distinguish between your face and a 2-dimensional representation of it. In addition, the face authentication becomes more accurate as we have not only x and y face details, but depth details as well. Authentication via 3D face recognition would also allow mobile device manufacturers to replace the space currently occupied by fingerprint scanners with more screen. Perhaps even more importantly, the process of authentication now becomes transparent, as there is nothing to touch\u2013the user simply interacts with the device as they always have. In a world where device size is basically no bigger than jean pockets will allow this is an opportunity mobile device manufacturers are sure to leap at. So, look for smartphone manufacturers to get rid of that wasted real estate very soon. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to want all the space you can get for your augmented reality apps! \u2013George Brostoff is co-founder and CEO of SensibleVision, a face recognition technology company with multiple patents.
