In his first couple of years as CEO, Ruth didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a lot of positive news to share and difficult questions from analysts were difficult to answer. This May was different. Electrocomponents is on a roll. Sales and profits are growing strongly and, as if trumpeting a new dawn, the company last week announced an acquisition, the first in 19 years. At a presentation in London on May 24, analysts who had grown doubtful of Electrocomponents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prospects following years of disappointing performance were bowled over. The mood was infectious: Chairman Peter Johnson roamed the UBS meeting room cheerily greeting investors, a happy smile dancing on his face; CFO David Egan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 soft-spoken and normally taciturn \u00e2\u0080\u0094 trotted out more than a few enthusiastic adjectives as he reviewed the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive financial numbers. Egan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation was glazed with rosier-than-usual projections and CEO Ruth, pumped up after announcing \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant progress\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the purchase of IESA \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a value-added services provider \u00e2\u0080\u0094 told the audience he was looking forward to a two-week financial roadshow to meet institutional investors around the world.
