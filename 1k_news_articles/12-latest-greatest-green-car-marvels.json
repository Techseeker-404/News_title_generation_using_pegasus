Further, automotive OEMs are leveraging electronics to address the demand for eco-friendly cars that are affordable, efficient and feature rich, without guzzling gas. \u201cAutomakers\u00c2\u00a0have brought an impressive number of highly efficient vehicles to market, giving American consumers more choices, whether they are looking for a compact car or a fully-loaded pickup,\u201d said Eric\u00c2\u00a0Junga, transportation research analyst at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). \u201cAnd as electric vehicles become more affordable and more enticing thanks to increased range and state-of-the-art features, sales are really picking up steam.\u201d Recently, in its 21st\u00c2\u00a0annual\u00c2\u00a0GreenerCars report,\u00c2\u00a0the ACEEE pointed to a dozen of the most environmentally friendly choices available from the many offerings of the 2018 model year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEach car is given a Green Score based on an environmental damage index (EDX), which reflects the cost to human health from air pollution associated with vehicle manufacturing, the production and distribution of fuel, and vehicle tailpipes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the report said. Many familiar brands of hybrid and full electric cars populate this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranking. For the past three years, vehicles with some form of electric powertrain dominated the ranking, leaving those rides with internal combustion engines (ICE) in the dust in terms of environmental friendliness. The mid-sized Hyundai\u00c2\u00a0Ioniq\u00c2\u00a0Electric captured the top spot for the second year in a row, earning the highest ever green score (70). \u00c2\u00a0The car combines high efficiency and practical size. \u00c2\u00a0The list made room for two notable newcomers as well. First, Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Model 3 got a nod as one of only two all-electric vehicles priced at under $40,000 (before tax credits) while still offering 200 miles of driving between charge. The Chevy Bolt, which ranked six, is the other.
