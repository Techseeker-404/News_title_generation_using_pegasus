While traditional CTFs cover a broad set of targets and skills, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often overlooked hardware design. This is not a surprise, as security researchers have primarily focused on the low hanging fruit of systems higher up in the software layers. But as software has become more secure over time, more security researchers are moving down the stack and targeting hardware as an alternative attack vector. Perhaps some of the most prominent CTF competitions are those organized by the DEF CON hacking convention (which have been happening since the early 90s). Competition organizers hide secrets, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cflags,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a target system, often secured by layers of protections and challenges. Participants compete to find as many flags as fast as they can. From cracking ciphers by solving mind-boggling cryptographic puzzles (and making sense of an unknown binary via reverse engineering) to dumping a human resource database after hacking into a heavily-fortified IT network of an imaginary multinational company, CTF challenges come in different shapes and forms. Discovering or \u00e2\u0080\u009ccapturing\u00e2\u0080\u009d a flag serves as proof that a participant has successfully solved all the necessary challenges to hack into the target system. CTFs have always been an engaging tool to help participants learn, practice and share key hacking skills and best practices with one another. Many encourage participants to form teams, and individuals across various proficiency levels collaborate, have fun and learn together. Beyond the educational benefits, CTFs also offer great community building opportunities by bringing passionate people together. Focusing on hardware security Attackers are becoming more proficient in hardware security, so defenders must also. The industry must come together to foster greater awareness about security weaknesses commonly associated with hardware designs. Through education and hands-on practices, more hardware designers will be equipped with design practices and skills to help secure their products. One excellent example of this type of industry effort is the community-driven Hardware Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), maintained by MITRE. With the latest release, CWE 4.2, the industry now has access to a catalogue of 75 commonly overlooked hardware weakness types organized under 12 categories. Each hardware weakness type illustrates a common security concern with one or more examples, followed by strategies on how to identify and mitigate the concern.\u00c2\u00a0The launch of an industry-wide, standardized system of enumeration helps pave the way for better hardware security, but there is so much more we can do. People learn and master skills in different ways. Some prefer to go through instructor-led trainings in classrooms, while others find independent reading and research more useful. Hands-on exploration and practice is another powerful method. I have seen firsthand how CTF competitions can help tip the scales when it comes to building industry awareness, and creating a mindset and skillset about hardware security weaknesses. Hack@DAC\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Hack@Sec are hardware-specific CTF challenges that offer fun and educational ways to learn about security mistakes often made by hardware designers as they develop system-on-chip (SoC) products. The first of their kind in the industry, over 150 teams made up of security researchers, university students and industry professionals from around the world have participated in these hardware CTF events over the past three years. The hands-on hacking opportunities allow participants to gain deeper appreciation of the challenges involved in detecting and preventing vulnerabilities in industrial-strength hardware designs. Many participants that have taken part in them are convinced that more work needs to be done, and some were even inspired to lead research and initiatives to make building more secure hardware easier. Anatomy of a hardware CTF challenges There are many ways to organize a CTF competition. Hack@DAC and Hack@Sec are the fruits of a highly successful industry and academic collaboration with a common vision. The effort starts off with the development of a realistic SoC hardware target for participants to \u00e2\u0080\u009chack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Organizers take a sophisticated open-source SoC, harden it with various industry-like security protections, and then introduce various security vulnerabilities for participants to find. The vulnerabilities are carefully chosen to ensure they provide a good representation of the hardware CWE. The organizers often insert multiple instances of each weakness type throughout the design to mimic the realistic challenges faced by SoC verification teams. These vulnerabilities involve varying degrees of difficulty and skill set requirements, so that the competition is a fun and educational experience to participants across all proficiency levels. Hack@DAC and Hack@Sec competitions are conducted in two phases. The first stage is somewhat of a warmup. Registered teams receive the hardware design, complete with a product specification that describes the threat model and security objectives of the design. Teams compete offline over a three month period to identify and submit as many bugs as possible. Judges score each submission based on the quality of the description of the issue, root cause, security impact, valid test case or exploit, and proposed mitigation. While teams can find most vulnerabilities manually after investing sufficient time, bonus points are awarded to those that create and use tools and methodologies to automate the process. Teams with the highest scores move on to the next round. Phase two is a live competition where teams apply the lessons learned (and any tools or techniques developed) in the first stage to analyze the same buggy SoC design. This time however, the design is extended with a few new security protections and a new set of security vulnerabilities. While the objective to find as many vulnerabilities as possible remains the same, the caveat here is that teams now only have 48 hours. With the time constraint, teams that prepare well in phase one by building automated capabilities to scan for issues and their variants across the design have an edge. An eye-opening experience In addition to highlighting the value of collaboration, creativity and thinking outside the box, Hardware CTFs underscore the role of open academic research in hardware system design, and bring awareness to the importance of making security assessment tooling available and easier for hardware designers to use. Academic researchers have historically been focused on a niche set of hardware security problems such as supply chain risks, physical attacks and cryptographic primitives. While these efforts remain significant, the industry can also benefit from more research that helps address mainstream challenges, including systemic mitigations of common hardware weaknesses, automated detection techniques, secure hardware design patterns, and more. Analyzing a buggy SoC forces participants to uncover and learn about a wide range of often-overlooked hardware security issues. These can include misconfigurations of security settings by embedded firmware, faulty access controls enforced by hardware, and debug interface credentials hardcoded into the design that can cause anything from information leakage and data corruption to the demise of an entire system. The consequences of these mainstream issues are just as significant as their niche counterparts. Throughout the process, CTF participants learn about the ways logic- and design-related weaknesses can be carelessly introduced by hardware designers, as well as the security impact those vulnerabilities can have if left unchecked. Hardware CTFs offer environments that mirror the pressure and constraints security assurance teams often experience in the real world. It helps participants appreciate the practical challenges that might not otherwise be obvious to them. Because there are more vulnerabilities inserted into the design than can be found manually in the allotted time, participants understand how powerful automated solutions can be when it comes to helping organizations become more proactive and productive in secure hardware development. The lack of available commercial and open source automation solutions also prompts participants to appreciate the critical gaps faced by practitioners that do the work every day. Building a more secure future The benefits of CTFs live on far beyond the awards ceremony. After the inaugural event in 2018, the Hack@DAC organizers open-sourced the SoC framework and bug list for the entire industry. Researchers can leverage the CTF infrastructure to test and benchmark new hardware security scanning tools, develop and demonstrate the values of novel systemic mitigations, experiment with innovative secure design patterns, and continue learning and educating themselves about hardware security weaknesses long after the conclusion of the events. Establishing better hardware security practices and capabilities is an imperative in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threat landscape. No single organization can accomplish the task alone. The inherent challenges associated with building robust, secure hardware demand more focus and stronger collaboration from parties throughout the industry and academia. The Hardware CWE serves as a community-driven primer that facilitates systematic analysis of hardware vulnerability patterns, detection techniques and mitigation approaches. Meanwhile, hardware CTF competitions take an orthogonal \u00e2\u0080\u009cLearning through Play\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach. Through a fun and educational medium, participants experience firsthand the key challenges faced by the hardware design community and walk away not only with new skills, but inspiration to take part in efforts to help the broader community. This leads to improvements in infrastructures and capabilities that professionals can leverage to create more secure hardware technologies that enrich the lives of every person on earth. Jason M.
