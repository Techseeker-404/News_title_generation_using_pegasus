Second quarter chip sales totaled $117.9 billion, up 6% compared with the first quarter and up 20.5% compared with the second quarter of 2017. The three-month average of sales for June reached $39.3 billion, up 1.5% percent compared to the previous month and up 20.5% compared with June 2017, according to the SIA, which reports numbers compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization.  John Neuffer  Growth of more than 20% for the first half of the year is no small achievement, particularly since 2017 semiconductor sales of $412 billion set an all-time high. The most recent WSTS forecast, released in June, calls for chip sales to increase 12.4% this year to reach $463 billion. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlobal sales have increased year-to-year by more than 20% for 15 consecutive months, and sales of every major product category increased year-to-year in June,\u201d said John Neuffer, the SIA's president and CEO, in a press statement. \u201cSales into the Americas market continue to be strong, with year-to-date totals more than 30% higher than at the same point last year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d June's chip sales were up year-over-year in all major regions, led by China (30.7%) and the Americas (26.7%). Sales were also up sequentially in all major regions except Europe, which showed a slight decline, according to the WSTS, an organization of more than 55 semiconductor vendors that pool sales data.
