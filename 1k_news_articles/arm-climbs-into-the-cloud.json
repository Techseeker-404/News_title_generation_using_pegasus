The news marks a re-commitment for the company that dominates smartphone and embedded cores but has yet to stake out a position in the cloud or the emerging market for AI accelerators. Starting next year, Arm and partners will roll out cores, IP, and SoCs optimized for servers, networks, and storage systems. They will come at an annual cadence in step with new process nodes. Arm promised 30% annual performance gains for the cores bearing a Neoverse brand announced at its Arm Tech Con here. The initiative comes at a time when smartphone growth has slowed to single digits and Arm has virtually saturated the microcontroller market. Meanwhile, the industry is buzzing with talk about so-called edge-cloud networks that carriers and cloud-service providers may build over the next few years as a new layer of the internet. Arm committed to roll out Ares, its first Neoverse-branded products in 2019, optimized for a 7-nm node. It will follow up in 2020 and 2021 with Zeus and Poseidon cores targeting 7-plus-nm and 5-nm nodes, respectively. Versions of the products will support SoCs packing up to 256 cores and up to eight DDR memory channels, eight HBM stacks, 128-Mbit caches, and fast interfaces such as CCIX. Arm did not detail any specific products ahead of keynotes on the initiative at its event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeoverse is different from what we have been developing for client devices [with the Cortex brand],\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Drew Henry, who joined Arm a year ago to lead the initiative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting high-performance secure products that will scale from hyperscale data centers to base stations and gateways at the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Neoverse plan is in lock step with the roadmap of TSMC, increasingly seen as the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s process tech leader. However, Arm said that Neoverse will also support Samsung and UMC nodes. So far, the Neoverse roadmap lacks any specific product details. (Images: Arm)  Long term, the brand is expected to include a variety of CPU, GPU, and other cores, as well as SoCs from customers. Arm will also offer architecture licensees to customers who want to customize Neoverse cores. Across all of the products, \u00e2\u0080\u009csoftware compatibility is an aggressive focus for us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brian Jeff, a Neoverse product manager. Analysts gave the move a thumbs up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to compete in the enterprise with the same cores that they are using in smartphones, and there are a lot of differences in performance and reliability, so having a separate set of cores should help them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Linley Gwennap of the Linley Group. In general, the cores should focus on instruction level parallelism with out-of-order pipelines and ECC and extensive parity checks. They could also adopt scalable vector extensions like Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AVX, said Gwennap. Neoverse and Cortex will be like Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Xeon and Core brands, according to Nathan Brookwood of Insight64. \u00e2\u0080\u009cArm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thrust into general-purpose servers has been difficult for them, but the server space is a lot more than general-purpose systems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, citing smart city and connected car sectors.
