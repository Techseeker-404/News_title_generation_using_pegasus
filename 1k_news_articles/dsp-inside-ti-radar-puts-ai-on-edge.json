Traditional radar lacks resolution and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t distinguish nearby objects. Radars are also known to sound false alarms and they consistently fail to process information fast enough to be helpful on the highway. However, automotive experts also recognize the redeeming virtues of radar technology, most notably its ability to work in all weather conditions. They believe that radars can team with vision sensors as the critical sensing technologies going into highly automated vehicles. Knowing both its drawbacks and advantages, a bigger question is where radar goes from here. Texas Instruments hopes to answer this question with millimeter-wave radar chips built on standard in-house RF CMOS technology. Introduced a year ago, TI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radar chips offer \u00e2\u0080\u009cless than 5-cm resolution accuracy, range detection to hundreds of meters, and velocity of up to 300 km/h,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the company.
