Deep neural networks are essentially a new way of computing. Instead of writing a program to run on a processor that spits out data, you stream data through an algorithmic model that filters out results. The approach started getting attention after the 2012 ImageNet contest, when some algorithms delivered better results identifying pictures than a human. Computer vision was the first field to feel a big boost. Since then, web giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook have started applying deep learning to video, speech, translation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 anywhere they had big data sets that they could comb to find new insights. Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the techniques are as fundamental as the discovery of electricity or fire. Read the rest of this story on our sister site Electronic Products.  "}
