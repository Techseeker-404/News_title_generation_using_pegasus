Under the heading of \u00e2\u0080\u009cconnectivity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the discussion covers vehicle-to-vehicle communication, in-vehicle smartphone apps to E112 (eCall in all new cars are mandated in Europe from April 2018), remote diagnostics, and over-the-air software updates. And the experts argue over DSRC vs. Cellular-V2X. We ponder the dangers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 once viewed as preposterous \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of cars getting infected by ransomware or rogue terrorists (or hackers just for fun) remotely taking control of our cars. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaving people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the operative tagline among the marketing types in the auto industry promoting V2V, ADAS and highly automated driving technologies. However, often left out of discussions about the connected vehicle ecosystem are people who ride bicycles and motorcycles. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this neglect is intentional. It tends to reflect a general lack of awareness toward motorcyclists and bicyclists in the United States. So, where are we today? Will bikes and Harleys communicate at all with cars and trucks in an increasingly connected world? According to an NHTSA report, roughly 5,000 motorcyclists die on the road every year in the United States. The latest data shows that fatalities among pedalcyclists jumped by 12.2 percent in 2015 compared to a year before, while motorcyclists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fatalities also increased by 8.3 percent.  In the last decade, the proportion of motorcyclist fatalities increased from 11 percent in 2006 to 14 percent in 2015.  So, what can we do about saving their lives?
