Lam Research is a vendor many electronics manufacturers turn to for new processes and tools to reduce their cost per bit from node to node. One of its latest offerings is aimed specifically at delivering better etching for current DRAM and future NAND flash memory devices. Vantex is a dielectric etch technology designed specifically for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sense.i platform, designed with chipmakers building 3D memory devices in mind \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in particular, those providing memory devices for smartphones, graphics cards, and solid-state storage drives, said Thomas Bondur, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corporate vice president of product marketing and business development for its Etch Product Group.  To reduce costs, the company is increasing device dimensions vertically and reducing critical dimensions laterally \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this requires pushing etch aspect ratios in 3D NAND and DRAM to new levels.\u00c2\u00a0 Thomas Bondur, corporate vice president of product marketing and business development, Lam Research As wafer fabs continue to get more and more expensive, he said, optimizing the use of space continues to be a priority for memory makers who have put pressure on suppliers such as Lam. They want more capability, more productivity, and more efficient use of the space as opening these memory mega fabs is getting into the multi-billion-dollar range. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe went off and made the decision to redesign our platform and chambers from the ground up, which is what drove the Sense.i platform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bondur. The platform has evolved from a radial one to a linear, side-by-side one with 10 chambers. This new design enables the use of higher than previously available radio frequency (RF) power levels so customers can etch high aspect ratio features at high throughput and achieve cost scaling, he said.  Meanwhile, advancements in RF pulsing technology deliver the tight critical dimensions control required to improve device performance. Lam is seeing new aspect ratios be applied on devices, and it requires more power and control to be able to drill deep and precise holes, said Bondur, as well as enabling customers to yield more and more devices across an entire 300mm wafer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we actually did it in a more efficient footprint than our six-chamber platform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 The company has focused on making preventative maintenance on the chambers easier too, recognizing that customers are trying to fit more equipment into a physical space. But optimizing space in the wafer fab is not the only concern for memory makers, said Bondur. Lam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sense.i etch platform also includes what the company has dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cEquipment Intelligence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which enables customers to collect data from hundreds of sensors monitoring systems and process performance. This allows them to utilize data much more efficiently so they can improve both on-wafer and wafer-to-wafer performance. Lam Research\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sense.i platform is designed with chipmakers building 3D memory devices in mind as it is looking to push etch aspect ratios in 3D NAND and DRAM to new levels, to reduce costs by increasing device dimensions vertically and reducing critical dimensions laterally.

Although last year wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a great year for the automotive industry, the electrification of cars and more electronic devices within the car means more demands for PCBs in this segment as it recovers and ramps up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe expectations are that these trends of having more and more electronics pour into cars will remain and will further drive the electronics and the PCB industries in the years to come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the meantime, the growing demand for 5G mobile phones is translating into a demand for more flex PCBs, he said, which is why it recently brought to market a new UV laser drilling solution and a new direct imaging solution \u00e2\u0080\u0094both operating on different platforms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to support roll-to-roll applications.\u00c2\u00a0 Its Infinitum platform is a roll-to-roll direct imaging solution for mass production of flex PCBs, which combines drum direct imaging (DDI), large scan optics (LSO), and multi-wave lasers to improve yields without sacrificing quality, said Alcobi. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also addressing customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desire for something more compact, as well as environmentally friendly. With DDI, printing is done on a drum, rather than table, and the Orbotech technology addresses one of the key challenges of materials handling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 driving a lot of material through the roll to control the tension and thickness without adding any kinds of distortion to the materials through the process. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe infrastructure and the architecture of the technology enables the printing on top of the drum in such a way that all this is done very smoothly while keeping the quality intact by delivering very stringent lines and spaces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Orbotech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Infinitum also consciously maximizes customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 available space by packing everything into one box so the overall footprint is small, said Alcobi. Similarly, its Apeiron platform is designed for high-speed UV laser drilling for roll-to-roll (R2R) and sheet-by-sheet panel manufacturing of FPCs so that customers can manufacture at high throughputs while maintaining high quality and accuracy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and can be used for a wide range of drilling applications, including blind vias (BV), through-hole vias (THV) and routing. This is achieved by leveraging its existing Multi-Path Technology, he said, which splits the beam into four different pathways, and combines with its recently developed Roll Inside and Continuous Beam Uniformity (CBU) technologies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have one light source, which we are able to split into four heads. While doing so we are enabling very efficient usage of the energy through the drilling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Orbotech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Infinitum platform is a roll-to-roll direct imaging solution for quality, high yield, and cost-effective mass production of flex PCBs for demanding markets such as smartphones and wearables. (Image source: Orbotech) The CBU technology basically assures that a quality assurance process takes place during the drilling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeasurement and assuring that the drilling is done in the right location at the right accuracy, without any deviations from the original plans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alcobi. Orobotech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s R2R technology not only contributes to the compactness of the solution, but the exchange of different rolls can be done quickly and conveniently. Both companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 manufacturing solutions are driven by the industry need to drive their costs down as they pursue their respective roadmaps. Lam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bondur said the global economy seems to have \u00e2\u0080\u009can insatiable appetite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for memory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do our best to try and get in front of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The company has been able to evolve its platforms in an iterative way, \u201cnot necessarily to outpace our customers, but to be ready for them when they need it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Orbotech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Infinitum and Apeiron reflect decades of investment in meeting the PCB manufacturing requirements of customers, said Alcobi. More and more flex circuitries are being put into smartphones, as well as other devices such as wearables, all of which require robust and efficient manufacturing with reasonable yields without compromising quality, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are plenty of drivers for flex PCB boards and we don\u2019t expect it to stop in the years to come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.
