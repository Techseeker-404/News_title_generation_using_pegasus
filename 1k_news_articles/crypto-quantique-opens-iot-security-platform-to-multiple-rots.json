In an interview with EE Times, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO Shahram Mossayebi highlighted why the fear of cyberattacks is preventing the full exploitation of the capabilities of IoT, and the market response to its hardware/software solution. He also hinted at partnerships for its QuarkLink software platform (which include Renesas, Silex Insight and EPS Global), and to expect a possible \u00e2\u0080\u0098big name\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chip customer in the next few months for its own hardware root of trust IP, QDID. Shahram Mossayebi First, on the topic of addressing the challenges of IoT exploitation and scaling, he sets the background. Mossayebi said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone talks about end-to-end security, but they often assume that key injection has already occurred. There are three key stages that need to be addressed from the software platform point of view. First is secure provisioning, where the chip is on board and requires key injection; then there is automated secure onboarding, where the device in the field is then connected to the cloud platform; and then there is security monitoring, which includes life cycle management.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot everybody does all three. Several of the solutions might do onboarding and monitoring, or just provisioning, or just key management. Other IoT software platforms for device management and security are incomplete.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is where he believes the Crypto Quantique differs. The QuarkLink platform is available to semiconductor manufacturers and systems integrators that use root-of-trust (RoT) solutions of their own, or those sourced from other vendors. The platform was originally designed to work with Crypto Quantique\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own quantum-derived root-of-trust IP, called QDID (which stands for quantum-driven identity). QuarkLink handles provisioning, including secure firmware and cryptographic keys, automated secure onboarding, and security monitoring, including firmware encryption, signing and secure updates over-the-air, and certificate and key renewal and revocation. With some RoTs, including QDID, QuarkLink eliminates the need for hardware security modules (HSMs) and key injection.

(Image: Crypto Quantique) Mossayebi explained that cryptography is tough as it is a very specialist field. As a result, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn reality, the industry is not fully exploiting IoT, because of fears of cyberattacks. In addition, it is also difficult to scale up the deployment of security. The other big challenge is that different market segments have different security requirements.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hence, while Crypto Quantique is targeting mainly semiconductor manufacturers, its IoT platform is supposed to be simple to set up. The company said QuarkLink can be set up in minutes by engineers without specialist IoT security knowledge. End-point devices are then connected to servers through cryptographic APIs, using just a few keystrokes to initiate an automated process capable of onboarding thousands of devices in seconds to a server platform, or to multiple platforms simultaneously. AWS, Microsoft and Mosquito are among the cloud services currently supported, with more following. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaking QuarkLink available for use with root-of-trust solutions other than our own enables engineers to rapidly and securely scale IoT deployments for their existing devices. It also creates a seamless path for upgrading to our own unforgeable root-of-trust IP, QDID, in future designs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mossayebi added. Crypto Quantique\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RoT, QDID, generates random, unforgeable cryptographic keys on-demand in silicon by measuring the quantum effects in chips manufactured on standard CMOS processes. The company notes that measuring and authenticating at quantum-level forms the basis of unique device identity and unbeatable security. Other hardware and physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can\u2019t offer full security it claims. Chips require secret key injection for authentication, which adds a point of vulnerability. The premise with Crypto Quantique\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solution is that a unique, silicon-based identity can secure billions of IoT devices without these risks. By harnessing quantum effects, it said this creates unforgeable identities and originate independent, tamper-proof cryptographic keys on demand. Market adoption Founded in London in 2015, and with $8 million raised to date (see: Startup Raises $8m to Deliver Unforgeable Secure Identities), we asked Mossayebi, who is one of the co-founders, about market interest and adoption of its hardware IP and software platform. He explained that they already have partners signed up to its products, including Renesas, Silex Insight, and EPS Global; and that they were in discussion with a couple of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig name\u00e2\u0080\u009d semiconductor companies for its QDID root of trust hardware IP. For the hardware IP, it is based on delivering in 65nm and 55nm processes, but the potential new customer engagement would be on a process node lower than 55nm. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model is based on licensing its hardware RoT IP, and then offering its QuarkLink security management platform either as a service or enable partners and customers to offer it as a white-labelled service under their own name. Security ecosystem partners Although not yet formally announced, Crypto Quantique is busily working with security ecosystem partners Renesas, Silex Insight and EPS Global to offer its QuarkLink based solution to their customers. With Renesas the companies have partnered to integrate QuarkLink\u2019s automated device onboarding and management into the Renesas RA ecosystem. Using Crypto Quantique\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cryptographic APIs, the QuarkLink platform will enable Renesas customers to rapidly and securely connect the roots-of-trust embedded in their microcontrollers to servers. According to the company, thousands of devices can be automatically onboarded within seconds, overcoming the scalability challenges presented by alternative solutions, without compromising security.\u00c2\u00a0QuarkLink supports devices that use Renesas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 secure cryptographic engine (SCE) and trusted secure IP (TSIP) blocks across the RA, RX and RZ microcontroller families. Silex Insight, which offers embedded IoT security IP, is partnering to combine its eSecure IP standalone security module with QuarkLink to enable rapid, automated, and secure onboarding of IoT end-point devices to cloud-based or in-house servers without involving other parties.\u00c2\u00a0The intention is that, with no requirement for security expertise, engineers will be able to use QuarkLink\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cryptographic APIs to connect thousands of devices to services with just a few keystrokes, enabling their devices and data to be protected. The third partner, EPS Global, provides secure IC programming-as-a-service to tier 1 automotive electronic suppliers, OEMs and contract manufacturers. The two companies have partnered to offer joint customers secure programming using the Crypto Quantique solution on EPS Global\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programmers at their programming facilities all around the world. This will enable customers using the Crypto Quantique QDID IP to program their microcontrollers securely at an EPS facility located close to their manufacturing factories. EPS Global will also promote and offer to its customers the full Crypto Quantique \u00e2\u0080\u0098QuarkLink\u00e2\u0080\u0099 software solution for end-to-end security capabilities.
