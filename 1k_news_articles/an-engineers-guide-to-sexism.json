But that happened Sunday night. Ten months ago, the ISSCC & IEEE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen in Circuits\u00e2\u0080\u009d group approached Teresa Meng to deliver a keynote at an evening session called \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorkshop on Circuits for Social Good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meng, who co-founded Atheros Communications (later acquired by Qualcomm) and was the first female professor in electrical engineering at Stanford, said that initially she was very reluctant to speak, because the subject was \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust too painful\u00e2\u0080\u009d for her to recount. The title of her speech was \u00e2\u0080\u009cWinning the game in a male-dominated industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Teresa Meng (photo: EE Times)  Her talk was nothing like what anyone in the audience would have expected in the semiconductor industry\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially at a highly technical conference like ISSCC, where only 2 percent of attendees are women. In a measured and almost methodical delivery, Meng talked about when and how gender discrimination happens, describing \u00e2\u0080\u009cunconscious\u00e2\u0080\u009d male behaviors that hurt women and discourage female engineers from pursuing higher positions in their organizations. She also discussed how women must pick their battles. Meng turned, with a note of sadness, to incidents in her life about which she has been silent for 30 years. Women are less trustworthy  Referring to the televised confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas in 1991, Meng recalled the testimony of Anita Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, against Thomas. Hill said that Thomas had sexually harassed her while he was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. While Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s every word was parsed and challenged by the all-male Senate committee, Thomas got away with playing the race card against a black woman. He said he was the victim of a \u201chigh-tech lynching for uppity blacks\u201d by white liberals who were seeking to block a black conservative from taking a seat on the Supreme Court. To Meng, this was a seminal moment that illustrated how women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words were not trusted in the male-dominant U.S. Senate. The same syndrome affected Hillary Clinton, Meng added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my opinion, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lie any more than any other politicians. But when she was given that label as a liar, people were willing to accept it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meng said. On the other hand, a male politician accused of lying, even habitually, tends to get the benefit of the doubt.\u00c2\u00a0 Similarly, when male and female offer different versions of a story, supervisors lean toward believing the guy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has happened to me, and the burden of proof has made my work experience much more challenging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meng said. Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contribution isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as valuable  Another form of discrimination is that women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contributions are taken lightly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI often had this experience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meng said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile brainstorming, I share my own idea. Then a male colleague elaborates on it a bit more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The next thing you know, after a few exchanges, Meng\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea became his idea. Of course, if she ever tells people that it was her idea, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being \u00e2\u0080\u009cpetty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Women are incapable of standing alone  A third form of discrimination is more insidious. Meng explained that too many people harbor the notion that women can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand alone. They think a woman need a male partner to share the burden. Essentially, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe women can succeed on their own, she noted. Meng made clear her gratitude for the help she got both at Stanford and Atheros from male colleagues, mentors and partners. But the conventional wisdom that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just good enough to do man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job\u00e2\u0080\u009d was no help to her or to any women. Pick your battle \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0  Sexism and discriminations confront women every day. Meng\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important advice to her female colleagues is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpick your battles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While acknowledging that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe all have emotions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meng said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to think clearly and strategically, after the emotions pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At stake is a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career and profession. In every conflict, women\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than men\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 need to measure the likelihood of success and proceed to either engage or retreat, accordingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to choose wisely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. Sexual harassment   Perhaps, one of the hardest things to hear for the ISSCC audience was Meng\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confession that her colleague had sexually demeaned her \u00e2\u0080\u0094not once but multiple times. Calling his treatment \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriate\u00e2\u0080\u009d but offering no details, Meng simply said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was deeply troubled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her trauma was deeper because this happened just as she started her career as a professor at Stanford. Meng decided to inform the department chair. "}
