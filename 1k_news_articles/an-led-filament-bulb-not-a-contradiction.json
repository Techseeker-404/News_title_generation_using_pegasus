Due to technical advances, regulatory mandates, and substantial cost savings, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and especially LEDs are taking over the lighting world in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. Still, there are many who long for the glow of that filament. Reasons vary: For some, it is nostalgia for their youth; for others, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hip, retro factor; and for others, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something almost primal about that glow, reminiscent of elemental fire (the glowing filament is certainly analogous to that). Reconciling the incandescent glow and the cooler lighting of LEDs and CFLs is a challenge (here, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccooler\u00e2\u0080\u009d means ambience, not color temperature). Perhaps there is a way to re-create it, however. A U.K.-based company founded by four students from the University of Edinburgh, Tala LED Ltd, has devised a way to construct a filament-like bulb using a string of LEDs to provide the look and ambience of the classic Edison bulb (see figure).
