Some of the hottest technology offerings on popular crowdsourcing sites are aiming to bring even more fun with gadgets, gizmos, and devices that enhance the fun of summer activities or harness the power of the season. These are some must-haves for tech enthusiasts looking for a boost to the summer holiday season. Today, companies and individuals alike, from hobbyists to senior engineers, are looking to crowdfunding sites for a variety of help from thinking up new ideas and measuring ideas to optimizing implementation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrowdsourcing platforms can now match buyers to a much broader base of sellers while reducing many of the administrative hassles, combining cloud, mobile, social, and web technologies to create new marketplaces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained a recent report from Deloitte. Deloitte identified a number of benefits to organizations that choose to go the route of crowdsourcing:  Faster design Faster prototyping Higher quality Greater elasticity Access to new pools of external talent Better engagement and retention of internal talent  We combed the Kickstarter and Indiegogo crowdfunding sites to find projects both fun and frivolous. All are still open for funding or purchase \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although some have reached the stated funding goals three or four times over. We found projects from all over the world from Barcelona and Hong Kong to the United States. The breadth and creativity of offerings is heartening, pointing to a wealth of high-tech products that will move the needle in interesting ways. Some leverage solar power to harness the summer heat. Others promise to protect summer hobbyists from wildlife ranging from mosquitos to sharks. We found products to offer a summer songfest that range from traditional headphone offerings to wired motorcycle helmets. And, of course, we had to add in a few summer toys, such as an electric scooter. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find something on this list, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fighting a summer cold, wanting to get a bright and beautiful summer smile, or trying to slim down to get fit for bathing suit season.
