Companies are considering a whole series of tools necessary for energy harvesting to satisfy the growing demand for energy. Growing concerns about the environment and the desire to save energy are some of the factors that are supporting the acceptance of technology at a deeper level in society. Applications related to IoT, building automation, and the strong demand for energy savings will be the driving forces of the energy harvesting market. The automotive industry will be another pivotal market, given the growing demand for clean energy in vehicles. Several countries from different regions offer incentives and investments for research and development in energy harvesting. The development of Smart Factory and IoT technologies and the desire to replace batteries less frequently (or to not use any at all) are among the other key factors that should drive the global market. The latest PMR (Persistence Market Research) report highlighted the growth of the sector, thanks to various measures adopted by various governments and organizations to deal with unprecedented emergencies or failures of any device. Furthermore, it is expected that the growing adoption of consumer electronics will consequently increase the global adoption of energy harvesting equipment solutions. The growing disposable income of consumers and the growing adoption of advanced consumer electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as China, India, etc., are some of the main factors driving the market globally. The commercial segment is expected to have a relatively lower CAGR than the global one (figure 1).      "}
