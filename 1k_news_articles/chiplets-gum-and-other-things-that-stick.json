This advice was geared to technology. For instance, it can be more important to focus on events like the Intel Architecture Day, which looks ahead only a few years, than it is to dwell on longer-range forecasters who prefer to look well beyond the end of CMOS technology. This was by no means a denial of the need to move to ever-more-exotic approaches to squeeze the last drops from Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law and to move beyond it. Far from it. Instead, the warning was to look beyond wafer processes and integration at the silicon die level in order to maintain an innovation curve akin to what we have known for half a century. The opportunities are both near- and long term. The drive to increased integration on the silicon die grew naturally out of the concept of scaling, as ever more functionality was required in designs. Of course, I speak of the system-on-chip, or SoC. A quick scroll through the catalog of any top-tier manufacturer will provide an immediate indication of the prevalence of SoC products. This once exalted moniker has become quite commonplace.

Despite talk of its demise, it was evident that Intel continues to invest heavily to push the technology curve. The Intel media relations folks were, as always, also hard at work creating easy-to-digest primers on the main points. Intel describes the way forward as \u00e2\u0080\u009csix pillars of technology innovation for the next era of computing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The six pillars At Architecture Day 2020, Intel senior vice president and chief architect (Architecture, Graphics, and Software) Raja Koduri presented the corporate vision for the next disruptor that will take the industry beyond the mobile revolution. Koduri looked past the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobile everything\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccloud everything\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the predicted exascale computing revolution and \u00e2\u0080\u009cintelligent everything\u00e2\u0080\u009d of 100 billion intelligent connected devices. That seems a bit off-putting, but this discussion was supposed to be more about today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology. On that note, let me go back to one of the six pillars of Intel technology \u00e2\u0080\u0094 packaging. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. Of the six pillars that cover the gamut up to new architectures and software for AI and exascale computing, Intel gives equal billing to process technology by identifying process and packaging as one of its technology pillars. Intel was a key driver of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law with its process innovation over several decades. Recognition of the importance of packaging is significant. Intel is well known for several initiatives that place packaging into the lead role for integration. Intel technologists developed the embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (EMIB) to increase interconnect density at key points within a standard package substrate. This concept replaced the idea of the large silicon interposer as the main interconnect bridge for connecting multiple die onto a package substrate. Among other features, EMIB eliminated the complexity of through silicon vias (TSV) keeping the concept more of an evolutionary and more cost-effective approach to heterogeneous integration. Foveros brought 3D chip stacking to logic devices. The next step combines EMIB with die stacking for higher level integration for products. Click the image above to enlarge. Evolution of Intel packaging technology (Source: Intel)  It may seem odd that the central term in all this has not been mentioned so far. The less functionally diverse die used in these package integration schemes is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cchiplet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This labeling differentiates purpose built individual integrated circuit die apart from more complex SoC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. I will show my age to point out there was a popular gum when I was younger that could be confused with chiplets. My autocorrect also prefers \u00e2\u0080\u009cchipset.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But put the Chiclets down because chiplets are sticking around. Going forward, there will be a lot to unpack from open standards to the research funding driving it to the new business opportunities both for new products as well as the services required to support development of the chiplet ecosystem. Thanks to EETimes On Air, Brian Santo turned me onto the investments DARPA is making in this space. There is a geopolitical aspect to all of this too. There is a lot to cover, so stayed tuned.  To understand just how close to a rapid expansion phase we are, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn our attention back to the mobile space. If you recall, that was the second big step Intel talked about and the middle of three epochs in the digital revolution. Today, mobile really is everything, and who better to clarify this than Qualcomm? Packaging is a design element Spurred on by EETimes on the Air, I naturally went to YouTube to find the sessions from DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Electronics Resurgence Initiative. The most notable was the plenary session by Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf.   Mollenkopf launched his talk with the assertion that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmobile sets the direction for the semi industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pointed out that Qualcomm once entered production at TSMC one or two nodes lagging, while it is now Apple and Qualcomm who are on the cutting edge of foundry technology. The mobile players suck up most of the production for the most advanced foundry process technology. Qualcomm 5G design evolution driven by packaging technology (Source: DARPA ERI 2019) A key point and central to the chiplet movement, Mollenkpf mentioned that the RF guys are \u00e2\u0080\u009cback in charge\u00e2\u0080\u009d because digital processing has reached its limit for improving mobile performance for 5G. He also recognized that much of the original research into things technologies like phased antenna arrays provide enabling technologies for today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercial entities and consumers. Perhaps increased focus on fundamental defense research will keep the US ahead in the commercial technology race. That is a topic for another day. Mollenkopf also mentioned the need for specialization considering that chiplets are designed and built for specific tasks. Next, he looked at the importance of packaging, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6companies looking to make packaging a design element.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For Qualcomm and its mobile device competitors, it is a war on many fronts. The fact that Qualcomm stresses the need for the most advanced process technology for its IC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as well as the latest packaging technology to marry many diverse chiplet designs is ample evidence pointing to the launch of a new age of semiconductor products.
