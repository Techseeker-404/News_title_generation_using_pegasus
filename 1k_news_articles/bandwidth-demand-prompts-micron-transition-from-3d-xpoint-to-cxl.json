Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president and CEO, said this week the memory maker would cease 3D Xpoint development and \u00e2\u0080\u009creprioritize our R&D investments\u00e2\u0080\u009d toward new memory products based on Compute Express Link (CXL), the emerging CPU-memory industry standard interface. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur decision was driven by our assessment of the 3D XPoint market opportunity in light of the expected impact of CXL and our new emerging memory products, on the future data center,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mehrotra said. Micron is currently in discussions with \u00e2\u0080\u009cseveral potential buyers\u00e2\u0080\u009d of its dedicated 3D Xpoint fab in Lehi, Utah. It hopes to complete a sale later this year, Mehrotra added. The Lehi fab led Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entry into the NAND market the early 2000s, later bringing Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version of 3D Xpoint memory technology into mass production. Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure marks a turning point for 3D Xpoint technology. While Intel has doubled down on its version of the memory technology with its Optane family of persistent memory, Micron is instead hitching its wagon to the emerging CXL standard designed to ease data center bottlenecks. Intel announced last fall it would use the proceeds of the sale of its NAND flash memory business to SK Hynix to invest in further development of Optane as the memory technology gains traction among data center operators. Observers noted that Intel has effectively been able to subsidize Optane by integrating it with server systems. Since 3D Xpoint non-volatile memory technology emerged in 2015, Micron said its strategy was providing data center customers with persistent memory technology for cloud-native infrastructure such as applications containers. The initial value proposition was cheaper DRAM and faster NAND. Evolving data center workloads changed those requirements. Sumit Sadana, Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief business officer, noted that CPU-DRAM bandwidth has since emerged as the limiting factor as data-intensive AI workloads dominate enterprise data centers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore DRAM is needed to ensure adequate memory bandwidth per CPU core,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sadana said this week in announcing the memory maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embrace of the CXL spec. Micron said it would seek to leverage 3D Xpoint process and product technologies as it transitions to CXL. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are going to be building products that are going to work with the CXL interface, and have a different optimization point as it relates to the performance and cost and power tradeoffs that exist in the hierarchy from DRAM to flash storage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sadana. Only the timing of Micron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement surprised observers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a successful 3D Xpoint product,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted chip industry analyst Tom Coughlin, who also noted that Micron could adapt its phase-change memory process technology developed for Xpoint to CXL. Coughlin and others note that data center demand for persistent memory such as Optane remains, and CXL is designed to handle heterogenous memory architectures. That also leaves an opening for Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Optane technology, which the chip maker is essentially subsidizing as it seeks to boost volume and find new memory-intensive big data applications in data centers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntel is in an interesting situation\u00e2\u0080\u009d having spun off its NAND technology to SK Hynix, Coughlin said, estimating it is selling Optane products at half the price of DRAMs. As DRAM prices rise, Coughlin asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill Intel have the intestinal fortitude\u00e2\u0080\u009d to stick with its Optane strategy as it seeks to ramp volume?
