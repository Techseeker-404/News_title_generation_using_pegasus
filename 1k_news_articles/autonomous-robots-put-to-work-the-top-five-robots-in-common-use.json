From military and industry to energy and emergency services, robots are becoming part of the regular crew \u00e2\u0094\u0080 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for good reason. Here are the top five robot workers, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see them, and why. \u00a0  \u00a0  NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Curiosity Mars Rover. (Source: NASA)  Why robots Technology for autonomous vehicles has increased significantly over the past decade. The robots of today are equipped with sensors that can do everything from identifying motion and excessive moisture, to notifying operators in the event of abnormal temperature fluctuations and vibration levels. In this way, robots can help signal if what they are inspecting is about to break down, allowing crews to come in early, service machines, and prevent significant breakdowns. Comparatively, robots are also cheap. Aside from the initial purchase cost and scheduled maintenance, the costs of \u00e2\u0080\u009chiring\u00e2\u0080\u009d robots can be much less than hiring people for 24/7 surveillance. The industries using autonomous cars and robots Energy Drones play a significant role in the energy sector. For years now, the flying autonomous devices have been used to monitor the need for machine maintenance, and for security surveillance. Drones are so popular in the energy sector, they even have their own summit. In the first report of its kind released last year, drones were found to play a significant role in the energy sector. In a survey conducted by the Energy Drone Coalition and DRONEII.com, more than 67 percent of the energy companies that responded to the survey said they used drones in energy operations. Approximately 50% of companies that participated in the survey said they used drones in-house. Most of the companies even admitted to having a drone division/department. Drones equipped with infrared technologies seemed to be key in energy operations. Energy companies said they used drones primarily for maintenance and facility inspection, though they also indicated interest in R&D to explore the use of expanding drone use into other areas of operations. Emergency Response Emergency response units have also started using autonomous robots. For example, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries just created an autonomous firefighting robot that drives itself to fires that would otherwise be inaccessible to human firefighters. The autonomous vehicle consists of two main robots connected by hose. The robots operate as a water cannon and a hose extension for fighting fires. The role of autonomous robots for emergency response is also like to expand. In a paper published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), researchers looked at the use of autonomous robots for use in natural disaster relief in Indonesia. In the case study, researchers looked at the potential for using autonomous robots with facial recognition, backpropagation neural networks, and camera/video feed to find and assist victims of natural disasters in Indonesia. Military Autonomous robots are also getting heavy usage in military applications, mostly for surveillance purposes. Regardless of cost, the military can send a robot into many dangerous, high-stakes scenarios without having to risk a soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Robotic devices can also be used for gaining discreet intelligence. SDR Tactical Robots is a company that specializes in tactical robot development for military use. It advertises the use of autonomous and radio-controlled cars for tactical surveillance, hostage negotiations, HAZMAT investigation, and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD). The military also relies on a number of other autonomous robotics, such as drones, and drones that deploy yet more drones. Industrial Sector The industrial sector is also beginning to use autonomous robots for machine surveillance and security. One example includes Spot Mini, a creepy looking robo-dog that has onboard cameras and sensors for added surveillance at job sites. Drones are also used within the industrial sector to monitor the health of the machinery and survey difficult areas to access otherwise. Applications include mining, seaports, oil and gas, and a number of other industrial facilities with lots of hard-to-reach places and many things that could go wrong. Though not used for security or surveillance purposes, Amazon is leading the front in autonomous shipping robot\u00c2\u00a0technology. Amazon relies on more than 800 robots for its impressive semi-automated shipment fulfillment operations. Top Five Autonomous Robots for Job-Site Surveillance There are literally hundreds of robotic devices on the market. Still, a handful stand out. Here are the five top autonomous robots you could see at a shopping mall or park near you.
