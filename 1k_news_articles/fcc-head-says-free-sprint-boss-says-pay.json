In a keynote session at the conference, Marcelo Claure, CEO of Sprint, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there is anything wrong with charging more for a faster track for faster traffic \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 some customers are willing to pay more for faster service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsumers like it that way. Some are willing to spend more than others, and consumers make that decision.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marcelo Claure, CEO of Sprint at Mobile World Congress (Photo: EE Times)  This sentiment, from a supporter of the FCC chief, echoes much of what Pai has long argued about the virtues of market-driven regulation. However, in speaking so bluntly, Claure undressed the assurances by Pai that the internet would remain \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree and open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  FFC Chairman Pai "}
