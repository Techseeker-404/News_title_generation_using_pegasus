Tesla doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t merely send software updates to a telematics unit inside a vehicle to update maps and apps and other software inside in-vehicle infotainment systems. It can directly send software patches to a relevant, individual ECU, for safety, security or feature upgrades. Tesla OTA software updates (Source: www.teslarati.com)  No carmaker anywhere, except Tesla, has yet been able to pull this off. After all, there is no such thing as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbug-free software,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed Egil Juliussen, director of research for infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for automotive at IHS Markit. For that reason alone, today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software-rich vehicles should come with OTA capabilities to correct software errors. This corrective function is even more crucial for \u00e2\u0080\u009cconnected vehicles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Juliussen pointed out, in the event of an attacker exploiting software vulnerabilities to disable a car or harm passengers. When that happens, carmakers should be equipped to quickly update\u00c2\u00a0the vulnerable software to prevent further damages. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesla is one exception. Its system architecture is built from the ground up to make OTA easier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juliussen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost car OEMs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that luxury. They have to figure out a way to make incremental changes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Surge in OTA suppliers, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Tier 1 and 2 suppliers are keenly aware of carmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growing demand for OTA solutions. In parallel, software vendors experienced in providing OTA updates for the mobile industry have begun shifting focus to the automotive sector. They figured that connected cars are, after all, \u00e2\u0080\u009csmartphones on vehicles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Many of these OTA suppliers have been snatched up by Tier 1 and 2 companies.  In early 2015, Harman International Industries acquired Israeli-based Red Bend Software, a provider of software management technology for connected devices, and OTA software and firmware upgrading services. Harman was later acquired by Samsung. In 2016, Wind River\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 when it was still a part of Intel\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 added the Arynga software product line to its automotive portfolio. Arynga, a provider of OTA update software for automotive solutions, was known for software-over-the-air\u00c2\u00a0(SOTA) and firmware-over-the-air\u00c2\u00a0(FOTA) update technologies. Two weeks ago, Wind River revealed that\u00a0Ford Motor Company\u00c2\u00a0is using its OTA update technology. Wind River boasted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cWind River Edge Sync\u00e2\u0080\u009d technology \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan provide differential updates that can minimize data update size, transmission time, and memory usage for updating vehicle software over the air.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Last year, Aptiv, then known as Delphi Automotive, bought Michigan-based startup Movimento to integrate its OTA platform. Aptiv\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to help automakers collect and analyze car data to detect flaws, extend the reach of recalls, patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities and speed development of autonomous driving. Here , a company developing automotive mapping and mobility services, has unveiled\u00c2\u00a0OTA Connect, which the company claims is an open-source solution designed to integrate into an automaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backend servers.  Other companies in the OTA platform market include Bosch, Continental, Airbiquity and ATS Advanced Telematics Systems. Know vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 network topology  All these moves illustrate the scramble among auto tech suppliers and OEMs in need of OTA. However, according to observations by Colin Bird-Martinez, a senior analyst with IHS Markit, most OTA efforts are about sending software updates to telematics units. None addresses ECU software updates for elements like air bags, power trains, body control or safety. The reality is that OTA for the connected vehicle is a whole different kettle of fish compared to OTA for a smartphone. To pull off automotive OTA [from the cloud to ECUs], said Bird-Martinez, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need two things: deep knowledge in computing hardware and familiarities with a variety of in-vehicle network communication topology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, for software patches to be communicated directly to ECUs, an OTA vendor must be familiar with a variety of hardware units inside a vehicle. Bird-Martinez asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes an ECU come with two memory banks so that when something goes with the software updates, it still has an older program in the other memory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBinaries tend to need more space.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While updated data could be compressed, an OTA vendor should still worry if a particular ECU to which it is sending a software patch has enough headroom in its on-chip memory. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all. Bird-Martinez said that different ECUs are connected to different types of in-vehicle communication network. Such networks range from Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay, Local Interconnect Network (LIN) to Media-Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) and Ethernet. OTA platform suppliers need to know all the nuances of in-vehicle communication networks to effectively communicate software updates. Ever heard of Excelfore?  Enter the world of Excelfore. Although Excelfore is little known, the Fremont, Calif.-based company has a decade of experience developing protocol stacks for automotive in-vehicle networks. Those in the know respect Excelfore for its technical chops in understanding the complexities of in-vehicle networks. Lately, Excelfore has been developing its own cloud-to-device OTA platform, called eSync. The goal is to enable carmakers to send software updates from cloud to a sensor or ECU inside a vehicle. Mark Singer, director of marketing at Excelfore, told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur expertise has grown out of a car to the cloud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Today, Excelfore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eSync has four customers\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 three are \u00e2\u0080\u009cmainstream, established car OEMs\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009canother is an automotive startup,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Singer. They are all already working on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull eSync implementations in their vehicles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Excelfore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yet unnamed customers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just experimenting with eSync. They are deploying it in full production models, he stressed. Excelfore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eSync OTA platform enables them to send software updates to five to 10 electronic devices inside their vehicles, said Singer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut not all of the ECUs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Partnered Content: Find out how serial Flash tech is evolving to meet the new requirements of Industry 4.0 design.
