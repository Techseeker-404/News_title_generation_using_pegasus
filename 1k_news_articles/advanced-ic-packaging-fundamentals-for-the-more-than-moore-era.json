What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving the next generation of IC packaging? What does the ongoing disruption in multi-die advanced packaging look like? Our Special Project examines advanced IC packaging technologies, looking at the road ahead for a critical manufacturing capability that could help revive flagging western chip makers. Transistor scaling is running out of steam, making advanced IC packaging another manifestation of engineering black magic. Layer after layer of transistors are being stacked in 2.5D and 3D packages while technology behemoths like Intel Corp and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. strive for tighter integration between process and packaging technologies.  Chip scaling has reached the point of diminishing returns. The next phase of semiconductor innovation will focus on integrating a myriad of chip components. Our Advanced IC Packaging Special Project looks at the challenges and the opportunities.  In the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore than Moore\u00e2\u0080\u009d era, process engineers need to understand next-generation integration technologies while back-end engineers build extremely dense packages. System-level design engineers also need more clarity on this tectonic shift in the semiconductor world. However, it seems there is little understanding of how this transition will unfold. For instance, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the die versus what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the package? What are the fundamentals for designing advanced packages? EE Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sister web site EDN, has compiled a special section dissecting the advanced IC packaging challenge. Gareth Kenyon provides a detailed treatment of heterogeneous integration technology and how it enables semiconductor device manufacturers to combine functional components from different manufacturing process flows into a single composite device. Ravi Mahajan, an Intel Fellow, makes the case for tighter integration between process and packaging technologies, explaining how heterogeneous integration could help achieve this goal. Based on an interview with Georgia Tech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Arijit Raychowdhury, Junko Yoshida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examines\u00c2\u00a0the need for tighter integration between semiconductor processing and packaging technologies. Raychowdhury also notes memory innovations that could propel silicon integration as scaling declines. Rich Quinnell takes a close look at the FOWLP technology and it place in the advanced packaging world, explaining its face-up and face-down variations. Like stacked IC packaging, FOWLP solutions have exploded during the past decade. Viewing IC packaging from an EDA perspective, Keith Felton provides an update at the new initiatives such as digital twins for virtual prototypes. He also explains concepts like precision manufacturing handoff and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgolden signoff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The special section wraps up with a glossary of fundamental terms in the engineering literature that create a new vocabulary for advanced IC packaging. Knowing these basics can help engineers understand the ongoing disruption in the packaging technology arena.
