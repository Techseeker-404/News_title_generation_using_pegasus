On the list of required viewing between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve are A Charlie Brown Christmas, It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Wonderful Life, Home Alone and A Christmas Story. The decision on Christmas Eve is whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Alistair Sim or Reginald Owen version of Dickens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 A Christmas Carol. On Christmas Day, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be time for Christmas in Connecticut and Holiday Inn. What I want to watch is the easy part. How I watch them is another matter altogether. I should be watching all the DVDs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve amassed over the years in the run up to Dec. 25. I have some of them, and I know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re around here somewhere. The strange thing is, I seem to have an aversion to opening a jewel case, extricating a disc, placing it in my Blu-ray player and pointing a remote at the TV to make it play. I, like a growing number of the TV watching public, prefer to stream my movies and TV shows. Now that broadband speeds are zippier \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Wi-Fi is far more reliable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no tradeoff with streaming vs watching a disc version. A lot of new video content is available in 4K resolution, and that has boosted the rep for streaming, too. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not laziness, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think, that makes me choose the streaming route. Partly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s familiarity. I can use the same remote I use every day rather than hunting for the Blu-ray remote, which has way more buttons than I want to negotiate. And I can keep the TV at the number two Roku input rather than experimenting with the less-frequented 1 or 4 to find the Blu-ray player. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more that streaming seems newer, fresher and more efficient. DVDs feel like old technology. That shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter given that It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Wonderful Life is in black-and-white, and Clarence gets his wings whether I view it on DVD or Netflix. Except it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on Netflix, this year at least. A search for the December classic shows it aired on USA Network on Dec. 11 at 8 p.m. and Dec. 12 at 9 a.m. I would have had to be sitting in front of my TV at those times to watch it because I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look far enough ahead to program the DVR to record it. Now that is old school. Fortunately, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an abundance of options via video-on-demand (VOD). Netflix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss was Amazon Prime Video\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gain. I used the voice search feature on my Roku remote to find It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Wonderful Life is showing for free on Amazon Prime Plus, and for a $2.99 rental on Vudu, Fandango Now, Redbox, Google Play and Row 8, a streaming service I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard of, which licensed movies from Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros. The Jimmy Stewart classic was also showing for free on Freebie TV, a channel on Roku that offers, you guessed it, free content without a subscription. My search for A Christmas Carol brought up more than 10 different movies, including a 2019 version with a female Scrooge; cartoon renditions; and the George C. Scott, Jim Carrey, Patrick Stewart, Vincent Fagan takes, along with Reginald and Alastair. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even a Barbie iteration. Very few are free during the high season. I can watch Reginald Owen on any of seven channels, most of which are charging $2.99 (Apple TV+ and Vudu are gouging viewers by another buck). Roku informed me that I can watch it for free via my HBO Max subscription, which was helpful. Alastair Sim is only on one channel via Roku: an Amazon Prime rental for $1.99. The VOD market is either a wonderland or a hot mess, depending on your stake. The market took off this year when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed consumers in front of their screens, and now everyone wants a piece of the action. For now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a win-win for everyone but cable TV and satellite companies, which continue to hemorrhage subscribers. But they see the writing on the wall, too. In an \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t beat \u00e2\u0080\u0098em, join \u00e2\u0080\u0098em move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d NBCUniversal launched its Peacock service in April first to its Comcast customers (and Cox subscribers) and then nationwide in July. Viewers choose whether they want limited free content supported by advertising or to pay for it with lots more programming options. NBCUniversal signed a content deal with ViacomCBS, too, to sweeten the pot. ViacomCBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Paramount will launch a streaming channel in 2021, joining Disney+ and HBO going direct to consumers. ViacomCBS also bought ad-supported Pluto TV and Fox snatched up the free Tubi service this year, as well, to reel in budget-minded viewers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting crowded inside the telly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and harder to discover content among the more than 200 services now airing in the U.S. Consumers are confused by all the choices and not sure how to navigate them. I rarely watch live TV anymore, unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the World Series, Super Bowl, The Weather Channel or a debate (gladly there won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be one of those again for a while). I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m solidly in the TV Everywhere age where we watch what we want, when we want, on whichever device we want. We can subscribe to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and Disney+ indefinitely, or we can do it month by month. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got company. Just over 60% of U.S. broadband households subscribed to two or more over-the-air video services in November, up from 48% in November 2019, says Parks Associates. No longer are we held captive by the cable, telco or satellite provider that delivers our TV signals. Now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re held captive by our broadband service providers that are sending the streams (in many cases, the same company). The biggest challenge for consumers in the streaming age \u00e2\u0080\u0094 amid a cornucopia of content \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is discovering movies and TV shows amid the overwhelming number of channels. The industry is on it, from several different directions. Ironically, participants at a December Parks Associates Future of Video conference discussed the growing need for aggregators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to serve the role cable TV companies held for decades of showing customers their viewing options in one convenient place. Roku and Amazon Fire TV are market leaders in that role today, and Google is reportedly working on a video aggregation feature within the Chrome browser. Those should go far toward harnessing a confusing and confounding video content space. Meantime, all I want for Christmas is for new technology to find me some old classics.
