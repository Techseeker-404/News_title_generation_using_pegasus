Such was the case when I was introduced to the electric surfboards from Onean. To be honest, thus far I\u2019ve never actually set foot on a surfboard myself, but it looked easy enough when I saw Elvis Presley doing it in Blue Hawaii. As you\u2019ll see in this video, these little rascals boast sufficient \u201cOoh Shiny!\u201d potential to make me want to immediately dispatch the butler to fetch my swankiest swimming shorts and prepare the Maxmobile for an excursion to the nearest body of water.   These boards boast watertight 5 kW jet propulsion units that allow them to reach speeds of 35-40 km/h (21-24 mph). They are controlled using a wireless remote system that incorporates a pressure sensor to control the speed of the board. The jet propulsion unit itself is a joy to behold. The torque from the custom-designed double stator brushless motor is transmitted to the main shaft my means of a magnetic coupling, thereby guaranteeing that the electric motor and electronics subsystems remain watertight, while also eliminating the wear-and-tear associated with traditional mechanical coupling mechanisms. I keep on returning to the above video. This truly is a surfboard for the 21st century. I can imagine everyone\u2019s heads turning as I proudly zip past on one of these little beauties. What about you? Could you be tempted to take one for a spin?
