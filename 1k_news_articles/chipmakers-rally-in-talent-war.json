A veteran executive put out a call to action at the Industry Strategy Summit here to help launch an initiative to do it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were a clearing house for the best and brightest once, but today it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a war for talent, and we are a step or two behind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dan Durn, the chief financial officer of Applied Materials. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, kids dream about Google, Facebook, and Apple; they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dream about us, and we need to change that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is personal for me because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, recounting how his father brought home an early chip made at Western Electric as the brains for a U.S. missile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat sparked something in me; it was the seed of a dream I am living today. My dream crystalized before I walked into a college,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Durn, an engineer by training who rose to become CFO of Globalfoundries and NXP before joining Applied. Durn called for attendees to join an initiative being developed in the SEMI trade group. It will include new committees on attracting young and diverse employees and a series of events reaching out to secondary schools.   "}
