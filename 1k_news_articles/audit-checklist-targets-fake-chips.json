The Electronic Components Industry Association (ECIA) said the checklist, designated AC7403, provides a framework for auditing and certifying electronics distributors through the Performance Review Institute (PRI). \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe audit checklist verifies that there is a system in place which should prevent counterfeit parts from getting into the supply chain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Don Elario, ECIA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president for industry practices. The audit checklist also helps vendors comply with an industry standard anti-counterfeiting standard that requires distributors to have a counterfeit mitigation policy in place. Drafters of that standard along with PRI and aerospace manufacturers helped development the audit checklist.\u00c2\u00a0 The checklist was drafted by members of an aerospace industry initiative called the Counterfeit Avoidance Accreditation Program, of CAAP, along with other suppliers. CAAP \u00e2\u0080\u009csubscribers\u00e2\u0080\u009d are: Ball Aerospace, Boeing, GE, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Rockwell Collins, UTC Aerospace Systems, Raytheon, and Rolls-Royce. \u00c2\u00a0The Defense Contract Management Agency also participated. The audits performed by PRI are similar to an aerospace industry accreditation framework known as Nadcap used to gauge suppliers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 manufacturing processes, including steps like chemical processing, heat treating and non-destructive testing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCAAP is very similar to Nadcap in that it is an industry managed program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Jim Lewis, CAAP program manager. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Nadcap model was used to develop the CAAP program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 The rollout of the audit checklist coincides with what other industry groups report is a decline in the number of counterfeit and nonconforming parts. ERAI which tracks supply chain issues, reported 771 suspect components last year. One possible explanation for last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marked decline could be fewer attempts to pass off fake parts or more sophisticated counterfeiting techniques, the industry group explained. Still, the rise of global supply chains has made it harder for auditors to track down counterfeit components, placing the onus on manufacturers to work closely with suppliers to track components that end up in mission-critical systems.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the current supply constraints in the marketplace, it is even more important for customers to know that their distributor is meeting the AS6496 anti-counterfeit measures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pete Shopp, Mouser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of global operations. The industry group said Mouser is so far the only electronics vendor to be audited. PRI is currently reviewing the audit. While the aerospace sector has taken the lead in efforts to keep fake components out of the supply chain, other sectors of the semiconductor industry are developing a range of anti-counterfeit technologies. Among them are so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009citem-level\u00e2\u0080\u009d RFID tracking along with authentication technologies such as holograms, watermarks, inks and dyes.

The industry watcher Research and Markets predicts the global anti-counterfeiting market will grow at an annual rate of more than 10 percent to $24.2 billion by 2020. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 George Leopold is the former executive editor of EE Times and the author of  Calculated Risk: The Supersonic Life and Times of Gus Grissom\u00c2\u00a0(Purdue University Press, Updated, 2018).
