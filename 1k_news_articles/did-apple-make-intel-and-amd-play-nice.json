Pigs have flown, and dogs and cats are living together. Broadcom is trying to buy Qualcomm, and Intel is marketing a multi-chip package that combines its processor and with a discrete graphics chip from AMD. The Broadcom-Qualcomm thing can best be explained by Hock Tan\u2019s quest for world domination. Tan told the Wall Street Journal earlier this week: \u201cWhen a business in No. 1 in technology and No. 1 in market position, we acquire it and put it on our Broadcom platform and \u00c2\u00a0grow through that strategy.\u201d Sounds reasonable. But it\u2019s really hard to see this deal coming to pass for a number of reasons. As for the Intel-AMD alliance, that might be even more interesting, particularly given that just days after the announcement came word that Intel had hired away AMD\u2019s graphics chip head to give developing a discrete graphics competitor to AMD and Nvidia a third try. Intel may have shown that it\u2019s willing to step away from the \u201cnot invented here\u201d dogma, but when push comes to shove it would really prefer it to be invented there. One interesting theory that we first heard from Kevin Krewell of Tirias Research is that, after decades of rivalry, Intel and AMD came together at the behest of Apple to produce a solution with the processing power of Intel\u2019s Core and graphics performance of AMD\u2019s Radeon that would be small enough to enable Apple to put it in an ultraslim MacBook. \u00c2\u00a0\u201cAs AMD is Apple\u2019s favorite graphics supplier, putting Intel\u2019s CPU and AMD\u2019s GPU together in one package is a win for the company.\u201d Analysts agree that this is a plausible theory, but given that Apple is notoriously tight lipped and demands the same of its suppliers, we aren\u2019t likely to find out about it for a while. \u201cIt will be interesting to see where this product turns up,\u201d said Linley Gwenapp, president and principal analyst at the Linley Group, in an interview with EE Times. \u201cIt is the kind of product that Apple would like to see. So, I think if this turns up in a high-end MacBook, then maybe it was Apple\u2019s idea.\u201d But Steve Kleynhans, a research vice president at Gartner, the new offering will open up all kinds of opportunities in lightweight mobile PCs for 3D gaming and virtual reality \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both targets for the Windows ecosystem, not the Mac OS. There\u2019s nothing to say that the collaboration was Apple\u2019s handiwork, he said. NEXT PAGE:\u00c2\u00a0Uniting Against Common Foe     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
