Here I answer the five most common questions posed in 2016.  Why is emulation suddenly the foundation of design verification flows? It once was considered too difficult to use and too costly for all but the most complex chip designs. For two unrelated reasons. One, the ever-increasing demand on performance of verification tools, and two, the remarkable progress in hardware emulation technology. The convergence of the two has propelled hardware emulation to the position of prominence in the verification toolbox of any design team. Today, SoC designs consist of two soaring domains: staggering hardware complexity and escalating software content. Only hardware emulation can handle the demanding task of verifying the integration of the two, and trace design bugs across their boundary. The invention of virtualization technology in support of hardware emulation, pioneered by IKOS Design Systems in the late 90s, opened up the path to new deployment modes, including the creation of emulation data centers. Emulation data centers magnify the return on investment (ROI) of emulators."}
