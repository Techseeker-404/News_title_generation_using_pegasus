Speakers were split over whether the number of transistors on a chip is continuing to double every two years as Intel co-founder Gordon Moore observed in 1965. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least a slowing of node transitions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rob Aitken, a fellow and director of technology at ARM, noting both a three-year span between 16-nm and 10-nm production and the power advantages of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDenard scaling stopped at 90 nm for the kinds of circuits we deal with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research provides a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfive-year process horizon so our internal roadmap is to 5 nm, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see [Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law] ending in that time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rory McInerney, vice president of Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform engineering group and director of its server development group.
