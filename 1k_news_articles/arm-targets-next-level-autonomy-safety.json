Both respond directly to the clamor for greater safety in the era of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. \u00c2\u00a0 Asked about the biggest challenges facing the automotive industry today, Lakshmi Mandyam, vice president of the embedded and automotive business at Arm, told EE Times in a phone interview: \u00e2\u0080\u009ca simpler and easier way to implement safety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ca scalable platform requirement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Calling ADAS \u00e2\u0080\u009ca foundation of autonomy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mandyam noted that Arm is \u00e2\u0080\u009cleading the charge for safety\u00e2\u0080\u009d by creating an easier path for both system developers and chip designers to execute and advance the safety of highly automated vehicles. \u00c2\u00a0 While Arm hopes to accelerate mass-marketing autonomous driving by offering its safety program and processors, leading automotive chip vendors were not waiting around for Arm to show them the way to safety in SoCs. Nvidia, NXP, Renesas and Intel/Mobileye, for example, have already developed and implemented safety features in their chips, the first three using Arm cores and Intel/Mobile on MIPS. ASIL D  Jim McGregor, founder of  Tirias Research, explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutomotive safety is done at many levels, including silicon, software, system, and the entire platform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe level of safety depends on the applications, but generally you have to ensure a certain level of reliability and failover protection for command and control systems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As a result, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis goes into the SoC design through secure environments, redundant processing on-chip or between chips, fail-safe instructions, etc. All of this is, then, designed in with the rest of the platform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If so, what are typical ways to implement safety inside vehicles? For example, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may have two cores or two independent MCUs or MPUs executing in lockstep in case one fails, or to determine if there is a dependency in the information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained McGregor. \u00c2\u00a0In current cars, this is limited to specific control functions. But he predicted that in autonomous vehicles, this much redundancy will be required in just about every system. Asked about how current automotive SoCs comply with ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) certification requirements, Mike Demler, senior analyst at the Linley Group, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo support ASIL D in the Xavier SoC, Nvidia, for example, implemented a custom lockstep mechanism and other features,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because ASIL C and D require redundancy. Demler said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUp till now, Arm supported these automotive requirements with Cortex-R. NXP and Renesas have used those CPU cores in their safety islands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Cortex-A76AE  Arm is introducing Cortex-A76AE, which it describes as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first high-performance application processor with split-lock capability, combining the processing performance required for autonomous applications and high-integrity safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cortex-A76AE is also designed to gun for performance per watt.\u00c2\u00a0Mandyam said that an SoC with autonomous-class performance at 250 KDMIPS typically consumes about 30W SoC. In contrast, an SoC with similar compute complex based on\u00c2\u00a06 core Cortex-A76AE configuration with CMN-600AE at 7nm would need only 15W, she noted.\u00c2\u00a0   "}
