That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that when aluminum electrolytic capacitors fail, they\u2019re easy to spot. That was the case when an AC mains power adapter used on a computer monitor failed. A few weeks ago, the computer monitor on my wife\u2019s PC began having intermittent problems. The screen image would shift to the right, making it impossible to reach the slider bar. At first, the fix was to have the monitor readjust itself through a sequence of button pushes. I made a diagram documenting the sequence so she could fix it herself. Then one day, the monitor failed. The \u201con\u201d indicator LED flickered when it should have stayed on steady, and the screen was dark. Fortunately, the AC mains power supply was external. Looking at the adapter\u2019s LED, I saw it flickering as well. There are many replacement 12-V, 4-A AC adapters on the market with prices ranging from $7 to $35, but finding the right one wasn\u2019t so easy. Why? Because some DC connectors had 2.5-mm inner barrel diameters, while others were 2.1 mm. Which one did I have? Lacking a caliper, I was able to determine that mine was 2.1 mm by inserting Allen wrenches into the barrel until I found one that fit. Unfortunately, I also needed a right-angle DC plug because whoever designed the monitor placed the DC power socket directly behind the monitor\u2019s stand support. Finding the right combination of output power, barrel diameter, and connector angle proved futile. Fixing the power adapter was a better solution and more fun. Opening the power adapter revealed two 1,000-\u00c2\u00b5F electrolytic capacitors (Figure 1). The tops of both caps were bowed outward. That was a clue. But as long as I had the power adapter out of its case, I had to take a look. Figure 1: Two 1,000-\u00c2\u00b5F, 16-V capacitors with bulging tops showed their age. (Click image to enlarge.) I really hadn\u2019t expected to see so much shielding around the switching power supply. Maybe this one wasn\u2019t just another super-cheap AC power adapter. After all, it worked for 12 years. The manufacturer is Linearity 1 Electronics. Figure 2 shows the underside of the power adapter, Note the second board over the main board where the shield attaches. The power adapter had more shielding than I expected. The shield connects to the main board\u2019s circuit ground through a single wire. I cut the shield along a line between the two arrows to separate the shield from the bottom board. Figure 2. The board underneath the main circuit board connects to circuit ground through a wire and to the wraparound shield. (Click image to enlarge.) Figure 3 shows the top side of the board and components, though there are some active components on the underside of the board as well. A transformer isolates the AC side from the DC side. Figure 3. The AC power adapter has a clean layout with the AC input and DC output on opposite ends. (Click image to enlarge.) I removed the wire, pulled the lower board up, and could then see the underside of the main board (Figure 4). Note the active and passive components on the board\u2019s underside. Given the thermal paste between the main board and the secondary board, it appears that this secondary board is used for both EMI shielding and for dissipating heat. Figure 4. The underside of the main board has both active and passive components. (Click image to enlarge.) Next, it was time to replace the bulging capacitors. That was easy. Figure 5 shows the underside of the main board with the capacitors removed (yellow circles). I did have to change soldering irons because my old one (an old Weller iron with a cork handle) didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide enough heat. Replacement 1,000-\u00c2\u00b5F, 16-V, 105\u00c2\u00b0C caps were available at my\u00c2\u00a0local electronics store\u00c2\u00a0for $1.07 each. I found some for\u00c2\u00a0$0.32 online\u00c2\u00a0but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to wait for (or pay for) shipping. Add $1.35 for some thermal paste around the new capacitors and between the two boards. Figure 5. Circles indicate where the failed capacitors used to reside. One of the failed capacitors appears in Figure 6, while Figure 7 shows a new capacitor still in the package. Figure 6. One of the two failed Samxon capacitors, removed from the AC power adapter board. \u00a0 Figure 7. One of two new NTE capacitors was all that I needed. Even if they only last a few years, the monitor will have already lasted a long time. After installing the new capacitors and adding some thermal paste, I applied AC power to the adapter with the DC connector open and measured the voltage. Sure enough, it close to 12 V and the power adapter\u2019s LED was on steady. Figure 8 shows the monitor working again. Total parts cost: around $3.50. All that was left was to reconnect the EMI shield by soldering it across the cut and inserting the power adapter back into the case. Figure 8. The LCD monitor is back in service. Perhaps I should have replaced the other aluminum electrolytic capacitors while I had the case open. The plastic case was held together with glue but easy to open. To keep the case closed, I used two cable ties. Management is happy, at least for now. Related articles  Radio Shack: Still Relevant for Neighborhood Engineers?
