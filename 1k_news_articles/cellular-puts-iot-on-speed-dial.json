They are playing a game of catch-up that some expect they will win with low-power wide-area (LPWA) alternatives led by Sigfox and LoRa that had a two-year-plus head start. That was the picture from the Mobile World Congress Americas, where each side made the case for its play in the emerging Internet of Things. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt feels like we are on the cusp of an IoT explosion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Karri Kuoppamaki, vice president of technology development and strategy at T-Mobile, which aims to roll out an NB-IoT network in the U.S. by June. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next and key is showing an ROI in real networks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hardy Schmidbauer, chief executive of TrackNet, a startup launched this year using LoRa and Wi-Fi for asset tracking. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarriers would like to wipe out their LPWA competitors, and I believe they will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Murphy, CTO in North America for Nokia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is zero doubt [that] carriers view this as one of their most important goals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d China Telecom appears to be in the lead with millions of users on a national network that it switched on in June for NB-IoT that supports 20- to 60-Kbit/s data rates over 200-KHz channels. The carrier charges as little as $3 a year for data, and its hardware suppliers such as Huawei and ZTE say that they soon will be able to deliver NB-IoT modules for less than US$5, said Qi Bi, chief technical officer for China Telecom.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe ran out of devices; people are lined up \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think NB-IoT will take off big time in China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. China Telecom was surprised by two early adopters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 bike-sharing companies such as Mobike and companies monitoring rented washers and dryers in apartment complexes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe thought our major app was meters, but bikes became one of our biggest customers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe IoT space is full of adventures and surprises.\u00e2\u0080\u009d China Telecom also supports LTE-M, which supports data rates up to 1 Mbit/s but is less efficient, using about 1.4-MHz channels. LTE-M will mainly serve wearables and will likely cannibalize smartphone revenues, he said. The carrier has seen its average revenue per user stay flat from 2G to LTE generations. It hopes that NB-IoT breaks with past trends, opening up new revenue streams by offering \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetter battery life, lower cost and better coverage\u00e2\u0080\u009d than LTE-M, he added.
