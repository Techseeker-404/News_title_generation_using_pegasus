The latest SEMI forecast calls for spending to rise 14 percent this year, reaching nearly $65 billion. Spending is forecast to rise an additional 9 percent next year to top $70 billion for the first time, SEMI said. The last time semiconductor equipment spending rose for four consecutive years was the mid 1990s.

While Samsung Electronics is expected to reduce its equipment spending from its 2017 level of about $18 billion, Samsung is still expected to account for about 70 percent of the equipment spending in South Korea this year, according to SEMI. SK Hynix is expected to increase its equipment spending in South Korea this year, SEMI said. Meanwhile, China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is expected to be the top region for semiconductor equipment sales beginning next year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 continues its dramatic rise in fab tool spending. Equipment spending in China is expected to increase by 65 percent this year and by an additional 57 percent in 2019, SEMI said.   SEMI noted that more than half of the semiconductor equipment spending in China in 2018 and in 2019 is expected to come from non-Chinese companies including Intel, SK Hynix, TSMC, Samsung and Globalfoundries. Domestic Chinese companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 backed by large government initiatives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are building a considerable number of fabs that are starting to equip this year and next year, according to SEMI. These companies are expected to double their equipment investments in 2018 and again in 2019, SEMI said. The trade group said other regions are also ramping up investment in semiconductor equipment, including a projected 60 percent increase in spending in Japan this year. Spending in Europe and the Mideast is expected to increase by about 12 percent, SEMI said, while growth in Southeast Asia is expected to be about 30 percent. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
