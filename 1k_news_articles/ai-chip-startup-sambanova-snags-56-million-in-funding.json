SambaNova (Palo Alto, Calif.), founded last year by a pair of Stanford University professors and the former head of processor development at Oracle and Sun Microsystems, is based largely on DARPA-funded research by the two professors on efficient AI processing.  Kunle Olukotun  Kunle Olukotun, a SambaNova co-founder and the company's chief technology officer, said in a press statement that the company's innovations in machine-learning algorithms and software-defined hardware would dramatically improve the performance and capability of intelligent applications. \u201cThe flexibility of the SambaNova technology will enable us to build a unified platform providing tremendous benefits for business intelligence, machine learning and data analytics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Olukotun, a pioneer in multi-core processing and a recent winner of the IEEE Computer Society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Harry H. Goode Memorial Award. Chris R\u00c3\u00a9, SambaNova's other Stanford processor co-founder is known for his work in database theory and has been recognized with several awards, including a MacArthur Genius Award. Joint work by Kunle and Chris on converged analytics has also recently won several awards, according to SambaNova. The third co-founder is Rodrigo Liang, former vice president of processor development at Oracle, who serves as SambaNova's CEO. \u201cWe have exposed our technology to some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest companies across different industries and we are excited about the broad applicability of our technology from enterprise to the edge,\u201d Liang said. In addition to Walden International  and GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), venture capital firms Redline Capital and Atlantic Bridge Ventures also invested in SambaNova's Series A funding round. SambaNova becomes the latest in a group of startups to receive funding in the red-hot AI chip space. The group also includes Silicon Valley startups Cerebras Systems and Wave Computing, UK-based Graphcore, and others.  Lip-Bu Tan "}
