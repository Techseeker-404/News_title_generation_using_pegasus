ORAN allows the adoption of multiple-vendor hardware and software that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on open interfaces and commonly developed standards. Marvell will join Facebook Connectivity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Evenstar Program to provide a 4G/5G OpenRAN distributed unit (DU) design based on Marvell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Octeon Fusion baseband processors and Arm-based Octeon multi-core digital processing units (DPUs). As 5G service providers in Europe and North America decouple from hardware that was provided by Huawei, Marvell is betting that more companies will adopt Open Ran as part of a disaggregated radio-and-base station concept that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely exclusively on one or two gear suppliers. After the administration of former US president Donald Trump designated Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5G equipment as a security risk, network providers started evaluating alternatives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGovernments are definitely promoting and throwing some funding at this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Schimpf, senior director of product marketing in Marvell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Infrastructure Processor Business Unit, said in an interview with EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGovernments will get involved in making it at least financially viable to to make this shift, certainly in the US and certain locations in Europe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The US government will mandate a \u00e2\u0080\u009crip and replace\u00e2\u0080\u009d for US operators in rural areas that partially adopted Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5G equipment that is integrated with 4G. ORAN is the leading candidate to eliminate the Huawei 4G gear and replace it with 5G equipment, Schimpf said. In 2021, Marvell expects that about 1.7 million to 1.8 million DUs will be installed globally. Within three to five years, as many as 10 percent of the new DU installations will be ORAN based, according to Marvell. In a traditional radio access network, the remote radio unit (RRU) hardware, distributed unit (DU) hardware, and control unit (CU) software are sold as a package. The goal of OpenRAN and the Evenstar program is to decouple these elements and provide alternative solutions supporting standard interfaces. (Source: Facebook) Initiatives like Facebook Connectivity with the Evenstar Program will start to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocratize\u00e2\u0080\u009d radio networks, allowing more choice and freedom to change portions of the network, according to Marvell. The Evenstar Program will replace more expensive field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with standard processors to reduce overall operating costs, Schimpf said. Facebook is helping by combining semiconductor suppliers, integrators and software vendors to make this push happen more comprehensively and faster, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are excited to welcome Marvell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DU contribution to the Evenstar Program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jaydeep Ranade, director of wireless engineering for Facebook Connectivity, said in a press statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarvell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience in baseband and DPU processors is a great addition to Evenstar as we work together to accelerate the adoption of high performance, innovative OpenRAN solutions globally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Recommended  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Crunch Time for Open RAN   Marvell will supply a fully integrated DU reference board featuring the OCTEON Fusion-O baseband, providing 4G and 5G PHY layer processing and an OCTEON DPU to run software functions. Facebook Connectivity will collaborate with Marvell to enable software operations on this solution and encourage multiple third parties to port protocol stack software as well. The DU supports up to 16 downlink layers at 100 MHz channelization with 10 Gbps downlink and 5Gbps uplink performance.
