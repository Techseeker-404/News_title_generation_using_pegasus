Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law will be declared officially dead.  It will be killed not by the laws of physics but by the laws of economics. Without faster computers, faster networks will become critical to efficiently connect clusters of hundreds or thousands of computers together. As a result, the high-performance networking market will grow much faster than the market for the computers they connect. Domain-specific languages and processors will proliferate.   Without the steady advance of CPU performance, software applications written in conventional general-purpose languages will feel performance headwinds. Thus, languages and frameworks like Spark and TensorFlow for Big Data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning will proliferate. Dedicated hardware accelerators will increasingly be optimized for these new languages and frameworks. The challenge for the application-specific hardware will be to choose the right class of workloads to accelerate and to be flexible enough to cope with a rapidly evolving software landscape. SmartNICs will go mainstream.   The first generation of SmartNICs are early domain-specific processors focused on accelerating networking, storage, and security. These SmartNICs really become I/O infrastructure co-processors. Demand for bare-metal cloud and security will push software-defined functionality into these programmable SmartNIC adapters rather than burdening the expensive and already over-taxed general-purpose server CPUs. 2019 will be the year of multi-cloud.   Customers now focus on quick and easy ways to have secure connectivity between a public cloud and their own private clouds. These hybrid clouds will more and more be linked to multiple public clouds as well. Bullet-proof security and Data Center Interconnect technologies such as Ethernet VPN will become critical to achieve multi-cloud connectivity. NVMe drives will surpass SAS/SATA in revenue.  Okay, this is not much of a prediction as NVMe may even achieve parity in 2018. But the availability of integrated single-chip storage controllers and NVMe all-flash arrays will accelerate these gains. Faster storage needs faster networks and the rise of flash will accelerate adoption of 25G, 100G and even 200G connectivity. Persistent memory will remain the technology of the future.   As has been predicted for many years, persistent memory will be the technology of the future again in 2019. The predicted hockey stick ramp will fail to materialize and the graphs will right shift a year or two, impeded by significant software barriers, high costs, and aggressive competition. The big incumbent vendors of flash memory have responded by improving the latency of their SSDs, narrowing the advantage of new non-volatile technologies. Moreover, the massive changes to software required to use a new class of non-volatile memory will slow the adoption of persistent memory. Consolidation in semiconductors will continue.  A few multi-billion-dollar acquisitions are ahead. Some of these may come as a surprise and later be perceived as David-eats-Goliath takeovers. "}
