China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s middle class is getting riled up by American tariffs and moves against ZTE. They are increasingly passionate about a government move to invest in its technological independence from the U.S. The veteran semiconductor analyst said that President Trump needs to take a page from President Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playbook and significantly increase federal investment in U.S. technology. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe DARPA [ERI] program is good, but we need something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10 or even 100 times that size,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jones. Reagan invested in big tech programs like the B-1 bomber, Star Wars missile defenses, and the global positioning system. They reinforced a position of technological superiority of the U.S. over the former Soviet Union. Today, China is outspending the U.S. It is ramping programs worth hundreds of billions of dollars in areas such as AI and semiconductors and other projects under its Made in China 2025 initiative. The spending in chips alone is breathtaking. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest foundry, SMIC, is expected to get $10 billion to ramp up 14-, 10- and 7-nm nodes in new fabs that could kick out 70,000 wafers/month by late 2021. Like many China initiatives, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear if the bold bet on SMIC will succeed. The foundry apparently has not yet been able to produce a FinFET process, although it struck a deal in 2015 to develop a 14-nm node with help from imec and Qualcomm. Now, SMIC reportedly will rely on Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s UMC for 14-nm technology and its follow-ons. Market success is another hurdle given that TSMC is already seeing a steep decline in its 10-nm sales, noted Jones.
