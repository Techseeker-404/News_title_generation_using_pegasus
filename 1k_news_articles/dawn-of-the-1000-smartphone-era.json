Even so, it\u2019s still a bit of a bombshell. While prices for nearly all consumer electronics goods are in constant decline and while the vast majority of smartphone vendors scrap by on razor thin margins, Apple and rival Samsung \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which together account for nearly all smartphone profits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are upping the ante. Why? Because they can. \u201cApple, more than any other tech company, has been able to create a premium brand for its products, and according to the laws of supply and demand, there is a certain demand at every price point,\u201d said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research.  The iPhone X is not ticketed for the mainstream. Despite the near universal appeal of the iPhone, $1,000 is a bridge too far for the vast majority of smartphone buyers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even existing iPhone users. This is precisely why Apple simultaneously rolled out the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, incremental upgrades to the product line with similar price points to their competitors (still a relatively robust $699 and $799, respectively). Ian Fogg, senior director of mobile and telecoms at IHS Markit, predicted that iPhone X \u201cwill still sell in enormous volumes because Apple has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to persuade consumers to shift their overall spending to place a greater share of their disposable income towards a smartphone purchase.\u201d \u201cPart of what iPhone has always been is aspirational,\u201d\u00c2\u00a0said Ken Hyers, director of emerging device strategies at Strategy Analytics. The iPhone is a \u201cluxury or near luxury device that really should be thought of as a halo product,\u201d he added.\u00c2\u00a0 \u201cIf you are buying iPhone X, you are already part of the iPhone ecosystem,\u201d Hyers said. \u201cAnd if you want to stay in the ecosystem, this is the best you can get.\u201d The iPhone X \u00e2\u0080\u0094 billed by Apple CEO Tim Cook as the future of the smartphone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is Apple strutting its stuff, packaging together a bunch of cool technologies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some of which may well be ahead of their time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to produce what amounts to a highly visible and well recognized status symbol complete with its own built-in flashlight. And, $1,000 sticker price or not, you can bet there will be lines around the block when it becomes available on November 3.
