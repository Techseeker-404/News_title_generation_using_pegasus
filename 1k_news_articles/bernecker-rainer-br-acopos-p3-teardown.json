It is ideal for use in automotive, printing, packaging, handling and robotics, as well as any process which demands extreme precision and speed. An impressive reduction in size of just under 70%, where heat dissipation would have previously been problematic, has been made possible with significant advances in both transistor and processor technology. These new components are smaller, cooler, faster and more precise.  Offered in 10 models, the ACOPOS P3 is available in 1- to 3-axis drive options, with power ranges from 0.6 to 18kW, or 1.6 to 44, along with several other alternatives, varying by model. The 3-axis drive is as compact as a conventional 1-axis drive, reducing space requirement by 69% with maximum power density. It can control extremely fast movements with precision by using short cycle time of current, speed and position measurements.  The ACOPOS P3 is among the fastest drives available, with sampling times of 50 \u00c2\u00b5s for current, speed and position control, made possible by advances in both hardware and algorithms. This is a substantial improvement over the 400 \u00c2\u00b5s update rate commonly found in drives manufactured only a few, short years ago. With these faster sampling speeds, virtual senor technology is now possible, and servo motors may be operated without an encoder. The open loop feedback is very similar to that found in variable frequency drives. The ACOPOS P3 compiles to safety regulations SIL3 / PL e / Cat, and may be ordered in either standard or safeMotion configurations. The integrated safety functions include STO, SOS and the new SLT (Safety Limited Torque) and run on virtual safety controller on the PLC Ethernet network.  Teardown  Model: 8EI8X8HWT10.XXXX-1.

This drive is ideal for an array of precision and complex applications. Because not all implementations are subject to CE/EMC requirements, the filter is no longer built-in; however, external filters and other safety features may be added, as needed. This scalability of hardware facilitates the connection of two, three-axis units tied into DC busses and daisy chaining line power, for painless expansion.  Designers will appreciate the minimal space requirement, given the smaller footprint of the ACOPOS P3, and reduced space necessary for filters, and fuses / circuit breakers. This all provides for a much smaller control cabinet, allowing for more options to locate it and taking up significantly less space on production floors, where real estate may be at a premium. Single cable motor technology makes for a cleaner profile and simple installation. Extraordinarily versatile, the ACOPOS P3 is equally suited for standard discrete equipment, CNC machinery or robotics application \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all may be driven with the same hardware. Designers need only to add a configuration, rather than programming since new software components are configured graphically. Engineers seeking a trim, cost-effective, and precise servo drive should absolutely consider the B&R ACOPOS P3 for their next build.   "}
