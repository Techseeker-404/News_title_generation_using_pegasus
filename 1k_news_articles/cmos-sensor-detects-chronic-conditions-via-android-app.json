The ability to rapidly detect and quantify multiple metabolite biomarkers simultaneously makes this device particularly useful in cases of heart attack, cancer and stroke, where rapid diagnosis is vital for effective treatment. The CMOS chip surface, described in a paper, \u201cAn integrated portable system for single chip simultaneous measurement of multiple disease associated metabolites,\u201d and published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics, consists of a 16\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c3\u0097\u00e2\u0080\u00af16 pixel array divided into multiple reaction zones (in fact, four discrete micro-wells, one for each specific metabolite) to detect and quantify four metabolites simultaneously from body fluid such as serum or urine. The device can be operated via any Android-based tablet or smartphone which provides data acquisition, computation, visualisation and power. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been able to detect and measure multiple metabolites associated with myocardial infarction, or heart attack, and prostate cancer simultaneously using this device,\u201d said the paper's lead author, Samadhan Patil of the University of Glasgow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s School of Engineering. \u201cThis device has potential to track progression of the disease in its early phase and is ideally suited for the subsequent prognosis.\u201d Professor David Cumming, principal investigator of the project from the university added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHandheld, inexpensive diagnostic devices capable of accurately measuring metabolites open up a wide range of applications for medicine, and with this latest development we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken an important step closer to bringing such a device to market. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an exciting breakthrough and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re keen to continue building on the technology we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed so far.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Partnered Content: Learn why signal chain expertise is Mission Critical for DoD] The researchers say the handheld device offers democratisation of metabolomics, which is otherwise confined within the laboratory, and offers a low-cost alternative to study complex pathways in different diseases.     The chip sensor is described in the paper as a 3.4\u00e2\u0080\u00afmm\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c3\u0097\u00e2\u0080\u00af3.6\u00e2\u0080\u00afmm chip designed and fabricated using an Austria microsystems (AMS) 350\u00e2\u0080\u00afnm triple-well process. It uses a 16\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c3\u0097\u00e2\u0080\u00af16 array of sensor pixels with an active area of 1.6\u00e2\u0080\u00afmm\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c3\u0097\u00e2\u0080\u00af1.6\u00e2\u0080\u00afmm, designed using Cadence Virtuoso software package. The active area surface of the CMOS chip, with pixel array for the sensors, was protected by four polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-blocks of 600\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c2\u00b5m\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c3\u0097\u00e2\u0080\u00af600\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c2\u00b5m and height of 1500\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c2\u00b5m (SYLGARD 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit, Dow Corning). These PDMS blocks serve two purposes: to act as a sacrificial material helping shape the micro-casting of black epoxy to fabricate the micro-wells; and secondly to protect the active pixel array area of CMOS chip against damage from epoxy or from physical damage through scratches. These PDMS blocks were carefully placed on top of the active pixel array using the assistive translation stage of a flip-chip bonder (Semiconductor Equipment Corporation, Model 850).

The epoxy mixture was carefully decanted over the CMOS chip surface around the PDMS blocks and over the contact pads. Overnight curing at a maximum temperature of 60\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c2\u00b0C caused the epoxy resin to harden. A clear plastic ring of approximately 8\u00e2\u0080\u00afmm height was placed around the CMOS chip on a ceramic chip carrier to form a reaction cell. Four quadrant separation walls were made using selective micro-cavity casting of black epoxy. These micro-wells have pipettable access, which means it does not require micro-tubing or pumps to handle the liquid, avoiding complex liquid handling. The method also allows instantaneous mixing of reagents with micro-wells, reducing the assay time by avoiding fluid travel delays that micro-tubing would introduce.
