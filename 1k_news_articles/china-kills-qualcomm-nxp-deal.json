Qualcomm had extended the deadline several times in the nearly two years since the deal was first announced, but said earlier in the day Wednesday that it would not extend the deadline again. \u201cThe decision for us to move forward without NXP was a difficult one,\u201d said Steven Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s CEO, in a conference call with analysts Wednesday. \u201cContinued uncertainty overhanging such a large acquisition introduces heightened risk. We weighed that risk against the likelihood of a change in the current geopolitical environment, which we didn\u2019t believe was a high probability outcome in the near future.\u201d Qualcomm said it would pay NXP a $2 billion \u201cbreak up fee,\u201d as stipulated in the agreement.  Steve Mollenkopf  China's Ministry of Commerce \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often referred to as MOFCOM \u00e2\u0080\u0094 never formally rejected the proposed acquisition, but did not approve it by Wednesday's deadline. Qualcomm and NXP agreed in April to withdraw and refile notice of the acquisition with MOFCOM at the ministry's request. MOFCOM's inaction on the Qualcomm-NXP acquisition has been characterized by observers as a consequence of tensions between the U.S. and China, which have in recent weeks erupted into an all-out trade war. The Trump Administration earlier this month enacted a 25% tariff on about $34 billion worth of imports from China and is moving to enact the same tariff on another $16 billion worth of Chinese imports. The Administration has also proposed adding an additional 10% tariff on another $200 billion worth of imports from China. China has enacted reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports and has said it will match any tariffs enacted by the U.S. with additional tariffs of its own.

However, the U.S. lifted the ban at the direction of U.S. President Donald Trump in what was an apparent gesture of goodwill amid negotiations on a possible trade deal between the world's two largest economies.
