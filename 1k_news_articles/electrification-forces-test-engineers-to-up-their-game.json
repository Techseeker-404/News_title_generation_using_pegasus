Each requires a completely different set of tests and test capabilities. And when the two technologies are smashed together (ahem, seamlessly integrated) in a hybrid vehicle, test time and cost have the potential to raise dramatically. With the ICE it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about physical test. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combustion mechanics, pressures, temperatures, fluids, mechanical linkages and power transfer, emissions management, and so forth. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turbos and superchargers and other methods to increase efficiency or power of controlled explosions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s translating linear piston motion to rotary torque and balancing power output with flywheels. With the electric powertrain it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about electrical test. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power electronics and switching frequencies, voltages and currents, induction and back EMF. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery capacity and discharge rates and thermal management of inverters and converters and regen power regulation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor/generator phase angles and laminate geometries and magnet placement and flux lines. When the two technologies are combined in various ways to form a hybrid powertrain it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about integration testing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control schemes and state diagrams and rule sets governing the interactions between the ICE and electric components. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about ensuring the system responds appropriately in all driving conditions and scenarios. The hybrid (in any of its flavors) is more complex than either an ICE or a full battery electric vehicle (BEV). \u00c2\u00a0 (Source: National Instruments)  "}
