I spoke with chief executives from both companies last week, and it was like a double-barrel blast from the past. In 1990, Echelon was a startup, coaching us in the emerging market for home networks. We wrote stories about whether these nets would come in the form of Echelon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary powerline technology, interesting new wireless options like HomeRF promoted by Intel, or some dumbed-down version of the Ethernet just starting to take off in the office. We imagined home media servers and all sorts of consumer tech exotica. Then Intel made a big bet to integrate Wi-Fi in notebooks. It spent a couple hundred million bucks driving the idea of hot spots, and after a few years, it was game over \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sort of. Wi-Fi became king of the home network, but the many smart connected devices that we imagined are still fairly exotic items for the adventurous.

Slowly, it grew an installed base said to be as large as 140 million nodes today. But standards came to powerline networks. Smartphones expanded Wi-Fi and established Bluetooth networks and put a virtual controller for them in everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pockets. A handful of other options from 6LoWPAN to Thread and Zigbee got a foot in the door. Enter Narbeh Derhacobian, chief executive of Adesto Technologies, a memory chip vendor that uses IOTS as its handle on the stock market. As a public company, Adesto needs to grow beyond its emerging-memory technology. So earlier this year, Adesto bought an Irish ASIC design company. Then this month, it bid $45 million for Echelon and its installed base of LONworks nodes and gateways, now bumping along the bottom of the IoT market hype at single-digit growth rates. Echelon is sitting on $15 million in cash, a sweetener for the deal.   "}
