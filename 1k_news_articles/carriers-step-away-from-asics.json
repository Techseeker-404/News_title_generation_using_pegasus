The Open Networking Foundation (ONF) will show its latest code based on the P4 programming language running on systems using chips from Barefoot Networks, Cavium, and Mellanox. The demo marks a significant change for ONF that initially based its work on its OpenFlow protocol. The group shifted last year to P4, an open-source project launched by Barefoot, after vendors hit limits with OpenFlow. The group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal now is to evangelize support for P4 among networking leaders. Broadcom, the dominant vendor of merchant switch chips, is said to be showing interest in P4. So far, Cisco, the leading provider of ASIC-based networking systems, is not showing interest in P4. ONF aims to cultivate an ecosystem of so-called white-box networking OEMs such as Quanta and Delta using its open-source software. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still early days for ONF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open-source code for the style of edge-cloud networks that carriers want to deploy. The so-called edge clouds aim to be more open, lower-cost alternatives to the central offices that carriers use today based largely on systems running a complex mix of ASICs and proprietary protocols. With the shift to P4, ONF has code for access networks in field trials, but software for mobile core nets is still in the lab, with trials a year or two away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at an interesting inflection point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Timon Sloane, vice president of marketing and ecosystems for ONF, calling the latest demos a second generation of software-defined networks (SDNs). The latest demo is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca glimpse of the edge cloud of the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d blending in work on SDN standards such as ETSI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Network Functions Virtualization, he said.   The carrier-led group hosts multiple open source projects to fill out the needs of distributed edge cloud networks.   Click to enlarge. Source: ONF    "}
