But this story doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily apply to other chip companies looking for a better valuation. Node names have become meaningless. The death of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law has been greatly exaggerated, leaving no clear alternative law for chip designers to believe and blindly follow. The semiconductor industry must, at last, outgrow its obsession with pitch shrinkage, and go creative with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cheterogeneous integration of different technologies\u00e2\u0080\u009d to push economic growth, according to Nicky Lu,\u00c2\u00a0 chairman, CEO and founder of Etron Technology. In short, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to stop using Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law as a security blanket. \u00c2\u00a0 Late last month when I saw Lu in Taipei, he launched a long disquisition on how Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law \u00e2\u0080\u009chas already gone virtual,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-planar\u00e2\u0080\u009d transistor structure for its 22nm technology.  Lu suspects that Intel wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appreciate him calling Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law \u00e2\u0080\u009cvirtual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law, in his opinion, long ago stopped serving chip engineers as a technology guide. Instead, Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law has been serving the investment community as \u00e2\u0080\u009can economic law that justifies return on investment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. As long as investors use it as a yardstick for the semiconductor industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth, chip vendors feel they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to acknowledge the obsolescence of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law. Even Lu doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly declare Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeal. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for the semiconductor industry to acknowledge that the industry \u00e2\u0080\u009cchanged the rules of the game\u00e2\u0080\u009d when Intel \u2014 followed by TSMC and Samsung \u2014 opted for a tri-gate structure [known as FinFET], Lu noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe semiconductor industry replaced line scaling (transistor size) with area scaling (miniaturizing the unit area),\u00e2\u0080\u009d thus fundamentally changing the very nature of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law, Lu said.\u00c2\u00a0 In Lu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to recognize that the semiconductor industry is no longer following the original template. Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law survived not by the shrinkage of the traditional transistor, but by riding variety of techniques \u2014 including advancements in packaging.
