Broadcom also suggested that Qualcomm is going through the motions to demonstrate due diligence to \u00c2\u00a0stockholders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of which want the two sides to reach an agreement. \u201cBroadcom believes Qualcomm's sudden request to enter into an NDA is a result of Qualcomm finally beginning to recognize the will of its stockholders,\u201d Broadcom said in a statement Monday (Feb. 26), hours after Qualcomm made public a letter from Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs to Broadcom President and CEO Hock Tan stating that Qualcomm's board had authorized the company to provide Broadcom with a marked up version of Broadcom's acquisition proposal that would resolve \u201call issues between the two companies other than price.\u201d The main sticking points between the companies have centered on Qualcomm's concern that the transaction gain regulatory approval. Qualcomm's board has twice voted to unanimously reject Broadcom's offers based on price and concerns over regulatory approval. While the companies appear to have made headway on sticking points surrounding the acquisition proposal during a second meeting of company representatives held Feb. 23, they appear to be far apart on the price Broadcom would pay to acquire Qualcomm. Broadcom last week cut its offer for Qualcomm to $117 billion from $121 billion after Qualcomm agreed to up the ante to acquire NXP Semiconductors, a condition that most observers agreed was essential in order for Qualcomm to complete the $44 billion buy of NXP. Qualcomm said Monday that its board of directors is unanimous that all of the proposals made by Broadcom to acquire Qualcomm \u201cmaterially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d Qualcomm further said its board \u201cencourages Broadcom to enter into a mutual due diligence and price negotiations.\u201d  Paul Jacobs  Qualcomm's statement Monday appeared to provide the clearest indication yet that Qualcomm's board is open to reaching a deal with Broadcom. However, Broadcom said the \u201cdisingenuous\u201d process outlined by Qualcomm \u201cdefers the question of price, even after Qualcomm's Presiding Director Tom Horton last week publicly stated that the Qualcomm board views Broadcom's proposed price as 'not even close.'\u201d In the letter, Jacobs proposes that the two sides enter an NDA and enter into \u201cbilateral due diligence.\u201d Jacobs said Qualcomm would deliver the proposed NDA to Broadcom's counsel.\u00c2\u00a0 Qualcomm stockholders are set to decide next week whether to elect six nominees to its board put forward by Broadcom in a proxy fight that will likely decide the fate of Broadcom's bid to acquire Qualcomm in what would be the largest high-tech acquisition in history. Broadcom's statement painted a different picture of the Feb. 23 meeting than Qualcomm's statement, saying among other things that Qualcomm refused to confirm that Qualcomm would hold its previously scheduled stockholder vote on March 6.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u201cQualcomm's owners deserve the chance to preserve Broadcom's $79 per Qualcomm share offer,\u201d Broadcom said. \u201cBroadcom, as a stockholder of Qualcomm, will fight to ensure the ability of Qualcomm's owners to determine Qualcomm's future.\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
