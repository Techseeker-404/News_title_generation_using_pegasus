The Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA) is pursuing the goal under such efforts as its High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems program and the Cyber Grand Challenge. Most recently, under its System Security Integrated through Hardware and Firmware (SSITH) program, DARPA has doled out $3.6 million to the University of Michigan for continued development of a microarchitecture that its creators say is unhackable. Instead of the usual \u00e2\u0080\u009cpatch and pray\u00e2\u0080\u009d software method of plugging security holes, DARPA wants to leverage new technologies to develop integrated circuits that are inherently impervious to software \u00e2\u0080\u009cend runs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Linton Salmon, program manager at the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Microsystems Technology Office. Intel has provided on-chip V-Pro security hardware in its Xeon microprocessor family for years. But DARPA is looking for a higher degree of protection, especially for military field computers, as a hardware security breach in the field could put soldiers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives at risk.  Michigan professor Todd Austin  DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated goal of \u00e2\u0080\u009chack resistance\u00e2\u0080\u009d appears to hedge a bit on whether truly unhackable hardware is achievable. But Michigan EECS professor Todd Austin, lead researcher on the project, claims his team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach, called Morpheus, achieves hack-proof hardware by changing the internal codes once a second. Austin likens Morpheus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 defenses to requiring a would-be attacker to solve a new Rubik\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cube every second to crack the chip\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security. In this way, the architecture provides the maximum possible protection against intrusions, including hacks that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, or those that cybersecurity experts have yet to discover. Morpheus thereby provides a future-proof solution, Austin said. Morpheus works its magic by constantly changing the location of the protective firmware with hardware that also constantly scrambles the location of stored passwords. Because passwords are encrypted \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which takes time for hackers to decode \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even the fastest hacker cannot find the vulnerability a second time after decryption. The technique used in Morpheus is already being used by military computers today in software. By casting key operations in hardware, however, Austin believes he can eliminate all classes of known vulnerabilities: permissions and privileges, buffer errors, resource management, information leakage, numeric errors, crypto errors, and code injection. Austin and his team will use the DARPA funding to design the hardware version of the Morpheus protection algorithm into affordable hardware in order to limit the cost impact of unhackable microprocessors. Morpheus is one of nine projects DARPA has funded under SSITH. Collaborating with Austin on the project are fellow Michigan EECS professor Valeria Bertacco; Mohit Tiwari, an assistant professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at the University of Texas at Austin; and Sharad Malik, an EE professor and chairman of the EE department at Princeton University.
