Industry reaction has been positive with both the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) immediately issuing statements showing relief that the President sees the industry as crucial to the nation. In his speech at the signing of executive order on supply chains, President Biden said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is about making sure the United States can meet every challenge we face in this new era \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pandemics, but also in defense, cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more.\u00c2\u00a0 And the best way to do that is by protecting and sharpening America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s competitive edge by investing here at home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Biden at the signing of the executive order supporting the semiconductor supply chain, highlighting the importance of chips to the nation. (Image: The White House) He highlighted how the shortage of semiconductors had caused delays in production of automobiles that also resulted in reduced hours for American workers.\u00c2\u00a0 Marveling at the chip he held up, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis semiconductor is smaller than a postage stamp, but it has more than 8 billion transistors \u00e2\u0080\u009410,000 times thinner than a single human hair in this one chip.\u00c2\u00a0 These chips are a wonder of innovation and design that powers so much of our country, enables so much of our modern lives to go on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just our cars, but our smartphones, televisions, radios, medical diagnostic equipment, and so much more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Addressing the issue of shortages, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m directing senior officials in my administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate.\u00c2\u00a0 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve authorized the bill, but they need $37 billion, short term, to make sure we have this capacity.\u00c2\u00a0 We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll push for that as well.\u00c2\u00a0 But we all recognize that the particular problem won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be solved immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The President said that his Administration will in the meantime reach out to allies, semiconductor companies, and others in the supply chain to ramp up production to help resolve the bottlenecks.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need help to stop playing catch up after the supply-chain crisis hit.\u00c2\u00a0 We need to prevent the supply chain crisis from hitting in the first place. And in some cases, building resilience will mean increasing our production of certain types of elements here at home.\u00c2\u00a0 In others, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll mean working more closely with our trusted friends and partners, nations that share our values, so that our supply chains can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be used against us as leverage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Part of this will involve identifying and building surge capacity that can quickly help ramp up production.\u00c2\u00a0 He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it will mean investing in research and development, like we did in the \u00e2\u0080\u009960s, to ensure long-term competitiveness in our manufacturing base in the decades ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The first part of the order is an immediate 100-day review of the supply chain for four vital products essential to protecting and strengthening American competitiveness. This covers semiconductors, key minerals and materials, pharmaceuticals, and advanced batteries like those used in electric vehicles. The second part is a long-term review of industry over the next 12 months to identify policy recommendations to\u00c2\u00a0fortify the supply chains at every step, and to start implementing those recommendations right away.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to wait for a review to be completed before we start closing the existing gaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the President added. A positive industry response The industry clearly welcomed the order. The SIA released a statement from Bob Bruggeworth, president, CEO & director of Qorvo and 2021 SIA board chair. SIA represents 98 percent of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue. He said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe welcome today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order and stand ready to work with the Biden administration to ensure the strength and resilience of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s semiconductor supply chains. As part of this effort, we urge the president and Congress to invest ambitiously in domestic chip manufacturing and research. Doing so will ensure more of the chips our country needs are produced on U.S. shores, while also promoting sustained U.S. leadership in the technology at the heart of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic strength and job creation, national security, and critical infrastructure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The ITIF, a think tank for science and technology policy, also released a statement from its vice president for global innovation policy, Stephen Ezell, who said: This executive order sends an important signal that the Biden administration is committed to strengthening the resilience and security of the supply chains that underpin U.S. competitiveness in advanced industries such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, batteries for electric vehicles, and rare-earth elements. Recent semiconductor shortages affecting other strategically important industries underscore the need to get supply chain policy right. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to investigate supply chains to find where advanced industries may face critical dependencies, vulnerabilities, and gaps. A thorough strategic review will show where trade rules need to be strengthened, and where we need to bolster domestic sources of supply.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just one way though, as Ezell points out the need for understanding reciprocity in the industry globally: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be effective, the review also must recognize there are reciprocal benefits from global supply chains for advanced technology industries. For instance, players in international supply chains are important customers for manufacturing equipment from the U.S. semiconductor industry, and they provide foundry capacity that supports the business models of U.S. fabless semiconductor producers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ezell added that the executive order is one of many steps the administration and Congress should take to bolster U.S. competitiveness in advanced-technology industries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica also needs\u00c2\u00a0comprehensive innovation and competitiveness strategies\u00c2\u00a0to spur needed investments in research and development, infrastructure, and skills. Otherwise, the United States will be at a competitive disadvantage versus China and other rivals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Impact of investment According to a report published by BCG last year, global manufacturing capacity is forecasted to increase by more than 50% from 2020 to 2030, presenting a market opportunity for the U.S. to attract a higher share of the new future fabs. According to its analysis, a $20 billion to $50 billion federal-government program of additional grants and tax incentives for new state-of-the-art fabs built in the next decade would be effective in reversing the last 30 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 declining trend in US semiconductor manufacturing.

(Image: BCG) Depending on the size of the program, the US could potentially double or triple its participation in the new additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity that still needs to be developed globally to meet the expected growth in market demand, achieving a 14% to 24% share, as opposed to just the status quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 6%.
