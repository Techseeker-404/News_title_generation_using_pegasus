Apple and anticipation need no explanation. Buzz is their business. The speculation for many years was what shape this new design would take. For a long time, pundits theorized that the design using ARM cores would see Apple more or less moving an A-series design from mobile over to (at least low end) Macs.

Inside Mac Mini If there was anything vanilla among the three products Apple announced, it was the Mac Mini. The Macbook Air is fanless, but the Mini is just a box with forced air cooling.

If you like it, great, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not my thing. I will make one point about the packaging, though. Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s origamists did a great job with the paper card used to contain the power cord under the unit. It was distinctively Apple.
