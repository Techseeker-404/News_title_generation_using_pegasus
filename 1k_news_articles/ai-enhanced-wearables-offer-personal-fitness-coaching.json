Out of all the techno-weenie events I keep my eye on, CES is the only one my wife (Gina the Gorgeous) is really aware of. Every time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mentioned on the news \u2014 and it\u2019s mentioned all the time \u2014 Gina calls me over to share information on the latest gadgets and gizmos. Of course, we at EETimes and Embedded.com have own editors at CES, so I\u2019m also receiving constant updates from the field. In fact, I was just reading Junko Yoshida\u2019s column CES 2017 Connects with AI, in which she discusses a variety of wearables and hearables that use artificial intelligence (AI) to grow smarter and serve their owners better. Sad to relate, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the Boltt company mentioned in Junko\u2019s column (there are so many things to see, and so little time to seem them all in). This is a shame, because I think Boltt has some very tasty technology (if you happen to be at CES, take the time to visit Boltt at booth 45930). I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about you, but I really need to work on being healthier and to lose some weight. I\u2019m actually targeting losing 60 lbs by the end of the year, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be easy, but Gina and I started a mega diet as part of our New Year Resolutions. We are now eating only healthy, organic, fresh-cooked food with no sugar, bread, or processed meats like bacon (sob sob). Today is Day #4, not that I\u2019m counting, you understand. Of course, dieting isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sufficient unto itself, I also need to exercise. The problem is that I\u2019m easily led astray. What I really need is a personal coach to keep track of all the exercise I take, to praise me for my efforts, and to cajole me into doing more. Sad to relate, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find one who is prepared to (a) meet my unpredictable schedule and (b) provide his or her services for free. Now, there are a variety of fitness trackers on the market \u2014 the names Fitbit and Garmin immediately spring to mind \u2014 and I\u2019ve tried these in the past. On the one hand, they have worked pretty well for me in that, for a period of time, they\u2019ve inspired me to count my steps. After a few weeks, however, I\u2019m sad to say that they\u2019ve fallen by the wayside. One issue has been accuracy (or the lack thereof). I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention names here to protect the innocent, but I found that one of my trackers reported substantially different results depending on whether I was walking down a road or walking on a treadmill, and it wasn\u2019t all that accurate in either environment. Personally, I find that not being able to trust the numbers is somewhat disheartening. I would also be interested to know more about my sleep patterns. I no longer sleep throughout the night, but instead wake up every couple of hours or so (one of the products mentioned in Junko\u2019s column was a smart bed that can detect when any of the occupants \u2014 including the dog \u2014 starts to snore, at which time it will subtly nudge the snorer into a new position to restore peace and quiet). Sad to relate, however, I have once again been disappointed with the technology I\u2019ve been exposed to thus far. All of which brings us back to Boltt, an Indian-based company whose technology is the brainchild of Arnav Kishore. In addition to many other accomplishments, Arnav was an international tennis champion at the age of 18 and he\u2019s currently one of the world\u2019s youngest CEOs (he reminds me of a younger version of myself, except that I\u2019ve never been a tennis champion or founded a successful high-tech wearables company, of course). We start with Boltt\u2019s smart shoe and advanced stride sensor, which provide real-time bio-mechanical data on speed, distance, cadence, stride sensing, and sports tracking, and transmits this data, via Bluetooth, to the Boltt AI app running on the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smartphone.  The sensor, which can also be attached to your own running shoe, is based on a 3-axis accelerometer (instead of the conventional 2-axis version) that tracks a much fuller motion of the shoe. This ability to monitor both longitudinally and vertically, coupled with advanced digital signal processing techniques and patented algorithms, allows the system to track a much fuller motion of the shoe, thereby providing best-in-class accuracy and offering real-time insights into the mechanics of how you run. All of this data is interpreted by the Boltt AI Coaching App, which is designed to motivate, guide, and inspire you to perform your best by giving you real-time coaching while you run and workout. The advanced stride sensor and training portion of the app are complemented by Boltt\u2019s smart band and life-coaching portion of the app.  The combination of the smart band and the app allow the user to keep track of, and analyze, his or her sleep, activity, and nutrition. By tracking and storing all of this data in one place, the app can provide users with a meal-by-meal analysis on daily nutrition/calorie goals and offer meaningful insights and guidance on how to live healthier. The AI coach is described as being a personality that assumes the persona of a trusted mentor, and the interface is said to be as simple as chatting with a friend. I have to say that this sounds like just what I need. I\u2019m going to try to lay my hands on a complete setup, in which case I shall report back in more detail when I\u2019m (hopefully) substantially slimmer and trimmer. How about you \u2014 do you think you would benefit from having an AI fitness and lifestyle coach?
