More industries are looking to connect their machines and applications, and more users are enjoying the functionality of their smart devices. Market research firm McKinsey predicts IoT\u2019s economic impact will be in the range of $4 trillion to $11 trillion per year by 2025. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and sensors are an essential part of the IoT phenomenon. SPONSORED: The future of smart devices: contextual awareness The best way to grasp the nature of this growing market is to look back at the world events and trends that topped the news in 2019 and are most likely to change the course of action in 2020, if not over the next several decades. The five most influential events in sensors this year were a long-debated acquisition, the resurfacing of a compute concept that\u2019s set to become the cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI), the launch of a promising new player by sensor industry veterans, a market-rejuvenating technology based on an effect discovered more than 100 years ago, and a push to think and act \u201clocally.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 1. AMS acquires 59% of Osram shares (Image: Osram) After months of negotiations and speculation, Austrian sensor company AMS AG finally acquired enough shares to take over photonics specialist Osram Light AG.\u00c2\u00a0 In December, AMS said the acceptance rate in its $5.1 billion (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac4.6 billion) takeover offer was 59.3 percent and\u00c2\u00a0exceeded the minimum acceptance\u00c2\u00a0threshold\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a055 percent.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur goal is to create a global leader in sensor solutions and photonics, based on European technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amy Fl\u00c3\u00a9cher, vice president marketing communications for AMS, told EE Times. Stressing the complementary nature of the two businesses, she added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOsram is the leader in visible- and invisible-light emitters and aspires to develop IC-design, optics, and optical-packaging capabilities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while AMS has \u201cIC-design, optics, and optical-packaging capabilities and aspires to add a leadership position in emitters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An underlying reason for the takeover bid is that AMS is heavily reliant on a single customer: Apple. Acquiring Osram expands AMS\u2019s business and diversifies its revenue mix. In the first half of 2019, AMS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumer business accounted for 75% of its total revenue, while the automotive business and the industrial and medical businesses accounted for 10% and 15%, respectively. The long-term goal is to generate 35% to 40% revenue in both the automotive and consumer businesses and 20% to 30% in the industrial/medical business. Calling the deal \u00e2\u0080\u009ca Christmas tale in which the rising star is acquiring the falling giant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d research and strategy consulting firm Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement said AMS would now be able to take a strategic foothold on the European semiconductor scene. The companies\u2019 revenue was a combined $6 billion in 2019, comparable to other big European players such as Infineon, STMicroelectronics, and NXP.\u00c2\u00a0 AMS said it aims to close the transaction in the first half of 2020.
