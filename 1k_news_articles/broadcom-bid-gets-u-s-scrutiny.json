It was dated March 5 and addressed to attorneys from both companies. The letter came along with an order from CFIUS. It requires Qualcomm to delay by 30 days a shareholder meeting on a proxy vote on rival board candidates. In addition, it prevents either company from \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaking any action\u00e2\u0080\u009d toward the merger while an investigation is in progress. The order also requires Broadcom to give CFIUS five days of written notice before taking any action on the move of its headquarters to the U.S. In addition, it orders both companies to provide weekly updates of their actions to comply with the order. In early November, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan met with President Trump to announce that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters will move from Singapore to the U.S., a process that Broadcom later said could be complete by May 6. However, Qualcomm submitted a request for review of the acquisition to CFIUS on Jan. 29. That letter triggered \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiple phone calls, emails, and meetings\u00e2\u0080\u009d with CFIUS and representatives of the two companies. Indeed, while the two companies were undergoing a heated public battle for the hearts and minds of investors, they also were engaged in an equally intense battle to make their case with the inter-agency group of regulators. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a result of these communications \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 CFIUS has come to believe that Broadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successful takeover attempt of Qualcomm \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 could pose a risk to the national security of the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aimen N. Mir, a deputy assistant secretary with the Department of Treasury who signed the letter. "}
