Demand for edge AI chips in sectors such as industrial is paused due to the pandemic, but will rebound in 2022, says the report By 2025, the edge AI chip market will reach $12.2bn in revenue, whereas cloud AI chip revenues will reach $11.9bn in the same time frame. While most AI training and inference workloads are handled in the cloud today, ABI Research predicts that growth in the edge AI chipset market will be driven by increasing demands for low latency and data privacy plus the availability of low-cost ultra-low-power chips designed specifically for this application. AI training and inference will be processed in gateways and all types of edge devices, right down to sensor nodes in the next five years.

The pandemic has also seen AI adoption in industrial manufacturing, retail and other verticals postponed. However, Su expects the market to rebound in 2022. Lian Jye Su (Image: ABI Research) \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is important to note that the impact on the chipset supply chain has been relatively minimal since fabrication factories in Singapore and Taiwan remained operational during the outbreak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Su said that 5G and WiFi-6 connectivity chip vendors, as well as those creating chips for autonomous driving, have not seen much impact to their product roadmaps, which bodes well for a rebound in demand in the edge AI chip sector. The report also highlights opportunities for chip companies big enough to span a raft of endpoint niches with their AI offerings, such as Intel with its Mobileye, Movidius and FPGA product lines.
