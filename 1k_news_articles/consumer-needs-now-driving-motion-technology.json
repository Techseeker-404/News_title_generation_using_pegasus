Rising consumer interest in devices such as robots and drones, however, is fostering increased integration and reducing the costs of implementing advanced motor control algorithms. As a result, consumer applications are now taking the driver\u2019s seat in moving motion control technology forward, which will benefit industrial users if they can revamp their design approach. \u201cCost driven applications are requiring algorithms that were formerly high-end,\u201d Trinamic Motion Control founder Michael Randt told EE Times in a recent interview. \u201cDrones, for instance, require fast current control that formerly needed an FPGA or DSP to implement, and other consumer-level products like 3D printers now need to use technologies that used to be only in military or medical systems.\u201d This need includes both advanced control technology and high-end motors themselves.  The result of this consumerization, Randt pointed out, is that motion control technology is increasingly being driven by consumer requirements such as size and cost. \u201cHigh speed motion control can\u2019t be done in software without a DSP,\u201d Randt noted, \u201cso consumer applications need to have the algorithms implemented in hardware. And it needs to be highly integrated, because drones don\u2019t have much space.\u201d Such specialized hardware is now practical, he added, because of the production volumes involved. \u201cDrones are like smartphones,\u201d Randt said, \u201cshowing up everywhere.\u201d Another requirement coming from consumer applications is ease of integration, Randt noted, to support the short development cycles of consumer products. Advanced motion control is drawing a new audience, he said, a software-centric one that neither understands motors nor wants to. \u201cThey want a simple interface, telling the motor what to do and getting back status information all in digital.\u201d The end result is development of both new digital motion control chips as well as new algorithms for features such as self-sensing of armature positions, Randt said. This consumerization of motion-control technology could have significant benefits for industrial users, though. The availability of low-cost, highly-integrated motor control hardware is making it easier to design high-end motion-control systems, as well. Industrial users embracing these devices will be freed to concentrate more on their application rather than the design of the servo control loops. But it will require a shift in design thinking. Traditional control system designs have a significant focus on analog sensors and control; these new devices will require a shift to thinking in digital terms. The new devices will also allow pursuit of new applications, especially in the Industrial Internet of Things space. \u201cMost people think of the IoT as involving sensors,\u201d Randt noted, \u201cbut there are a lot of actuators too.\u201d With small size, low cost, and (often) battery operation now available for motion systems, the usage opportunities expand significantly. \u00e2\u0080\u0094Rich Quinnell covers industrial control for EE Times.
