The operative word here is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmostly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time that both AI developers and the tech-gullible media ceased to marvel over the incredibly fast, powerful processors and advancements of sensor technologies. Yes, science has advanced. The bigger questions to ask are how we can be sure that robocar sensors are giving out accurate perception information, whether we can explain the decisions made by AI, and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 most importantly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 how we validate the safety of autonomous driving. Intel/Mobileye held a media event in Jerusalem last Thursday, offering a group of reporters a taste of travel inside Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s autonomous vehicle equipped with 12 cameras but no other sensors. The company is testing 35 AVs currently available \u00e2\u0080\u009cin inventory\u00e2\u0080\u009d out of some 100 vehicles that Intel previously promised to build before the end of this year.

(Photo: Intel)  The media event gave Intel/Mobileye an opportunity to show how far its team has advanced in AV development and to publicly explain a car safety concept called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The goal, of course, is AVs that behave responsibly on public roads. Industry observers applauded Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness to discuss its AV strategy. However, this demo opened the door to a host of issues that the AV industry, from Waymo to Intel/Mobileye, has yet to explore, examine, and test before L4 and L5 vehicles can hit the road without hitting something else. Issues include how to achieve \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue redundancy\u00e2\u0080\u009d in perception, how to explain objectively what \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe\u00e2\u0080\u009d really means, and how to formulate \u00e2\u0080\u009ca consistent and complete set of safety rules\u00e2\u0080\u009d agreeable to the whole AV industry, according to Phil Koopman, professor of Carnegie Mellon University. Separately, the public AV demo in Jerusalem inadvertently allowed a local TV station\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video camera to capture Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s car running a red light. (Fast-forward the video to 4:28 for said scene.) According to Mobileye, the incident was not a software bug in the car. Instead, it was triggered by electromagnetic interference (EMI) between a wireless camera used by the TV crew and the traffic light\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wireless transponder. Mobileye had equipped the traffic light with a wireless transponder \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for extra safety \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on the route that the AV was scheduled to drive in the demo. As a result, crossed signals from the two wireless sources befuddled the car. The AV actually slowed down at the sight of a red light, but then zipped on through. While Mobileye isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blaming the TV crew for this blunder, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reminder that the industry is still in the experimental stage. Computer vision-only approach for now  For months, technology companies, tier ones, and OEMs have been talking about \u00e2\u0080\u009csensor fusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 combining different sensor technologies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to help AVs figure out unexpected objects in the road. While practically everyone regards sensor fusion as a given, the industry is nowhere close to a methodology to validate whether perception information generated by each sensor is accurate, let alone whether information from multiple sensors can correctly fuse without any software glitches. The decision made by Mobileye to test its AV fleet powered only by cameras demonstrates its conviction that it must validate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first and foremost \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009ca comprehensive end-to-end solution from processing only the camera data.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Amnon Shashua "}
