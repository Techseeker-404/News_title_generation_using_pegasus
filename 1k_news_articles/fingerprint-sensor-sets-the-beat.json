Their convenience and speed make them preferred over passwords, facial recognition, retinal scanning or user-input patterns.\u00c2\u00a0 Common methods of defeating fingerprint sensors include creating a rubber mold of the finger, copying a fingerprint to a piece of tape or using the actual finger removed from the person. We recently discovered a combination fingerprint sensor and heart rate detector in a few smartphones that avoids these attacks. Typically, smartphone sensors map a fingerprint into a capacitance matrix on a chip with enough rows to span the entire finger.\u00c2\u00a0 Software algorithms match observed patterns to a stored pattern recorded during a training session and account for variances due to finger placement, rotation and pressure. A heart rate monitor works on a different principle, sending LED light through the soft tissue of the body that reflects off bones and is received by a sensor located near the LED.\u00c2\u00a0 The amount of light received varies mainly by the water (blood) content in the soft tissue. When the heart is relaxed a vein has less blood, but it expands significantly when the heart compresses, delivering a pulse. Combining a capacitive fingerprint sensor with a heart rate sensor eliminates a separate touchpoint for each function, the approach of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and S9. It also adds the security of knowing the phone was unlocked with a fingerprint from a live finger.\u00c2\u00a0 Goodix is shipping such a sensor in a few smartphones today. The combination sensor is actually smaller than the fingerprint-only sensor. A small sliver of silicon was added to the capacitive fingerprint sensor die for a small array of light sensors. The die cost increases minimally. The more significant cost added for the combination sensor is an external LED and the cost of adding light windows in the package for the LED light to escape and the reflected light to enter.

Source: ABI Research   Goodix does not promote the sensor for heart rate monitoring due to the low accuracy possible with the simplified heart rate sensor and the liability associated with monitoring heart rate.\u00c2\u00a0 For the purposes of security, the exact rate is not important\u2013just the fact that there is a pulse is key. So, chalk one up for the good guys, making fingerprint sensors more secure. Next, expect a temperature sensor to be added to further ensure the fingerprint truly is from a live warm-blooded person. \u2014 James Mielke is vice president of ABI Research\u2019s Teardown reports.
