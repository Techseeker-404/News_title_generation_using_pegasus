I'm hopeful but skeptical for a variety of reasons: cost (electronics don't come cheap), capacity (a trunk full of electronics doesn't leave much room for groceries), and perhaps most concerning, my experience and observation that completing the last 10% to 20% of a project takes 80% to 90% of the project's time, especially when it involves lots of software, many functions, and complex interaction among the many building blocks. I suspect that we'll be at Level 2 and Level 3 of the five-level autonomous-car hierarchy for a long time before we get to Level 4 and Level 5 (see \u201cAutonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences\u201c). We'll also need a good definition of what level of performance is \u201cgood enough.\u201d Will it be 95%, 99%, or 99.9999%? (We'll ignore the legal and liability issues in this assessment.)     Software bugs in vehicles won't end anytime soon.Source: Embedded.com.    "}
