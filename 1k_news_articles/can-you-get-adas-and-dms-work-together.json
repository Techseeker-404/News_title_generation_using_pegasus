The growing awareness that DMS can improve automotive safety is driving new regulations and safety ratings for new cars. The European Parliament has updated its General Safety Regulation (GSR) for type-approval requirements, while the Euro NCAP (new car assessment program) is completing its DMS test protocols. Delayed two years, the NCAP five-star crash rating program will start testing in 2024. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all, though. The automotive industry faces sobering evidence that the longer a driver uses the partial automation, the more careless he or she gets. Certainly, automakers want drivers to rely on the new bells and whistles they tout as safety features in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). However, drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 over-reliance on automation is breeding unsafe behavior. DMS sits smack-dab in the middle of the precarious man/machine relationship. A looming question is whether DMS can mediate this troubled marriage. Bryan Reimer In a recent EE Times interview, Bryan Reimer, research scientist at MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AgeLab, cited his long-standing advocacy for \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe need to fuse DMS data with active safety systems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reimer was an architect of the research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) that showed the adverse impact of the partial automation deployed in Level 1 and 2 cars. The goal, noted Reimer, is \u00e2\u0080\u009cto maximize safety in a way that leverages advantages of both the automation and human.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To ensure that the joint system [vehicle and human] is better than a human-only system, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne does need to think about developing strong data.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Source: MIT AgeLab) \u00e2\u0080\u009cADAS and DMS must be connected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stressed Colin Barnden, Semicast Research\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead analyst. What DMS is detecting in the driver must translate into such ADAS actions as braking and steering, Barnden noted. Mike Lenn\u00c3\u00a9 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntegration of internal and external sensing provides new opportunities for safety enhancement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d acknowledged Mike Lenn\u00c3\u00a9, senior vice president for human factors & aftermarket solutions at Seeing Machines. He cited \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo areas of value\u00e2\u0080\u009d in connecting ADAS and DMS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey include a) understanding the real-world safety risks to ensure the right human states are detected; and b) using DMS to threshold ADAS features.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A driver might, for example, have his hands on the wheel, but is he zoning out? Among the lingering challenges is \u00e2\u0080\u009cunderstanding how the [DMS] features should be adjusted to a range of driving scenarios/environments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lenn\u00c3\u00a9. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, how do you threshold distraction signals for urban vs. rural driving?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Add to this the issue of carmakers \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving the courage to make the HMI / vehicle response appropriate for the severity of risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lenn\u00c3\u00a9. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe severity of the safety risk should dictate the HMI and vehicle response.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Recommended  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Time for Automakers to Get Serious About Safety  Name the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Driver Monitoring Systems  Richard Schram A \u2018base version\u2019 of DMS We shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get ahead of ourselves. Euro NCAP, for example, is \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaking a very pragmatic, quick approach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Richard Schram, technical director at Euro NCAP, during an Affectiva-hosted web event about \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdvanced Safety Beyond Driver Monitoring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schram stressed that Euro NCAP wants \u00e2\u0080\u009ca base version [of DMS] on every vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u009d first; a technology roadmap then has to follow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you look for the perfect [DMS] system, we will never get there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For this base system, are we talking about camera-only, vision-based DMS? Given DMS test protocols under development at Euro NCAP, the focus is squarely on vision-based systems. Martin Krantz, Smart Eye CEO, quipped, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteering wheel torque sensors [used in Tesla, for example] are sometimes classified as DMS\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but they are becoming unfashionable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ophir Herbst Talking with EE Times, Jungo Connectivity CEO Ophir Herbst acknowledged, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDMS and occupant monitoring system (OMS) technologies are based on 2D cameras\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We actually have some companies that work with us (and above our stack) to measure the \u00e2\u0080\u0098cognition\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098state of mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the driver. OEMs in general are looking at additional sensors, but they realize cameras provide the most ROI in terms of various features. Cost matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eyesight Technologies, which has recently renamed itself Cipia, remains adamant that vision is the leading method for driver monitoring. Tal Krzypow Tal Krzypow, vice president of products, told EE Times, vision \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan detect eye closure, gaze, and facial expressions (among other capabilities), which are the most direct indicators for a driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drowsiness and distraction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEspecially for distraction, which is one of the leading causes for accidents, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no substitute for tracking the visual attention of the driver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Krzypow did not dismiss other sensors such as radar for monitoring respiration, but he stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the moment, the market is very much driven by regulatory requirements, which are best addressed by vision.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What about sensors for the next-generation DMS? Even though vision-based DMS is a priority for many OEMs, DMS developers won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop looking for sensors that could add new dimensions to what they detect. Martin Krantz Smart Eye CEO Krantz painted this broader picture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt CES 2020, we presented a radar based breathing detector.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Like many DMS technology suppliers also looking for occupant monitoring solutions, Krantz said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are also pursuing complete in-cabin sensing opportunities where one or two wide angle cameras keep track of the whole cabin and measure for body posture, child left behind, seat belts etc.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are also extracting facial expressions of all the passengers and mapping it to the basic emotions. The same is done in terms of identifying everyone in the car.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Krantz believes the car\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interior will be monitored \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith a multi-modal sensor package.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smart Eye plans \u00e2\u0080\u009cto continue to develop our software so that it handles multiple sensor modalities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some tier ones such as Valeo are reportedly exploring radar for \u00e2\u0080\u009cliving being detection\u00e2\u0080\u009d (i.e. babies, small dogs) left behind a vehicle. Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors might also have a role in DMS. A good example is a partnership between ADI and Jungo announced earlier this year. Asked why, Jugo CEO Herbst explained that ToF sensors allow better accuracy for algorithms such as face recognition, gesture, and occupancy/pose. He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn some cases, ToF sensors can provide redundancy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as detecting hands off wheel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ToF sensors will become available in DMS \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis upcoming year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. Another school of thought doubts that adding sensory modalities in DMS will solve such thorny issues as detecting driver drowsiness. Calling drowsiness \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe toughest nut to crack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Seeing Machines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lenn\u00c3\u00a9 said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe looked at brain activity, heart rate activity, respiration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Among physiological sensors studied were some developed and designed by academic institutions in Australia and Britain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe found all of these other sensors incredibly noisy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. Also, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are 101 reasons why your heart rate or respiration rate can change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With a DMS mandate approaching reality, Seeing Machines has reiterated its message that the \u00e2\u0080\u009ceyes have it\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ceyes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lenn\u00c3\u00a9 emphasized broad-based R&D findings that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you really want to know what\u2019s going on with someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention and cognitive state, you\u2019ve got to study their eyes and their face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Source: IEEE Pervasive Computing) Click the image above to enlarge. What and how should Euro NCAP test? The first priority in DMS testing is \u00e2\u0080\u009cto put the system in a car,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Smart Eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Krantz. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany systems that work on the bench don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work in the harsh environment of real car driving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Colin Barnden Some real-world surprises that upset DMS technologies include \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirect sunlight, streets lights, which create strobing effects,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Semicast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Barnden. Drivers wearing masks and sunglasses could also confuse a DMS. What then are \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust-check\u00e2\u0080\u009d DMS features? Many suppliers declined to say, citing their involvement with Euro NCAP to develop tests. But getting down to fundamentals, Smart Eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO stressed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cavailability of signals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to keep track of both the accuracy and the availability of the fundamental signals, such as head pose, eye lid opening, gaze direction etc. If these signals are not of high integrity it will not be possible to build a warning application on top, which is both sensitive and has a low frequency of false warnings at the same time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Krantz added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlancing on the cluster should not be mixed up with a microsleep, for example.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Describing Euro NCAP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s test protocols as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwork in progress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Krantz said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are confident that it will reflect the need for being sufficiently advanced so that it will not miss out on measuring the most important features of a DMS system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jungo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO Herbst listed likely requirements:  Identify head pose base distraction, e.g glimpsing a phone, adjusting infotainment Identify microsleep and other sleep events Identify long-term drowsiness via multiple signals (eyes, yawns, electroencephalogram, steering wheel) Various light conditions (day, night, direct sun) Varius accessories (glasses, sunglasses, hat, mask)  In the end, OEMs want NCAP-compliant systems to be cost effective, said Herbst: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDMS that can run on one of their existing compute options (infotainment, cluster).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Carmakers \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill also look at availability of additional features such as software updates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Further, tier ones will want a solution that easily fits their preferred chipsets, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRegulators do not dictate technology. They will focus on use and edge cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Is there a drowsy dummy? This is an odd question, but it addresses how Euro NCAP could test DMS inside a vehicle. Is there such a thing as a\u00c2\u00a0 drowsy dummy? Seeing Machines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lenn\u00c3\u00a9 said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur view is that a person/driver needs to be actively engaged with a system under test, either in a simulator or test track setting. How this will be implemented is not clear at this stage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but there will likely need to be some agreement on levels of drowsiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On microsleep, Smart Eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Krantz said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should warn not only for microsleeps, which comes very late in the process of falling asleep, but also for severe drowsiness stages where the driving performance goes down drastically.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He suggested, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPut drivers through the same scenario (long boring drive during the wee hours) in both simulator and in real driving where they self-assess their drowsiness during regular time intervals. The difference is that in the simulator you can proceed until they actually fall asleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In reality tests appear more complicated than Krantz and Lenn\u00c3\u00a9 implied. As Cipia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Krzypow noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrowsiness (as opposed to eye closure) poses a double challenge: it is hard to measure and hard to simulate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nobody has yet explained how Euro NCAP plans to meet the challenge. How can DMS stop annoying the driver? With all said and done, the nagging weak link in DMS technology is that when drivers get annoyed by too many false positives, they turn off the DMS, rendering it useless. Jungo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO acknowledged, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed too many false alarms would be annoying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At Jungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe limit alerts to clear distraction events, such as not looking at the road, using phone, smoking and the like. We do not try to assess today the \u00e2\u0080\u0098cognitive\u00e2\u0080\u0099 state of the driver, such as looking at the road but day-dreaming. This is indeed too error-prone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smart Eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO Krantz said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe key to minimize the error rate is to have very high precision in the fundamental signals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere need to be well designed and thoroughly tested applications that translate the fundamental signals into valuable driver state information and finally a well-rounded warning strategy, that informs the drivers without annoying them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Seeing Machines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lenn\u00c3\u00a9 agreed that driver acceptance is critical. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDesigning for the human is so important. You need to understand the behavior and associated risk, such as distraction, and build that understanding into the features so that it \u00e2\u0080\u0098makes sense\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to a driver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe amount of false positive alerts depends on other factors including the reliability of signal availability, which is also key.\u00e2\u0080\u009d MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Reimer, stressing problems that overly active driver-alert systems could present to consumers, noted a General Motors example. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGM seems to have developed a multi-stage alerting approach with Super Cruise that addresses this through a combination of reinforcement (silent cues) and escalating alerts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In theory, recognizing the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state (\u00e2\u0080\u009che is paying attention\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and connecting it to the DMS alert system can mitigate the annoyance factor. But Reimer said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not aware of any systems that are addressing cognitive absorption or mind wandering issues. This is an active area of research in our group as well as several OEMs and suppliers we work with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DMS on the road today EE Times undertook this article seeking to determine the mindset among leading DMS suppliers, and learning about their engineering efforts to develop safer driver monitoring systems. But in the real world, as Semicast Research\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Barnden often says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly easy to do driver monitoring so poorly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Consider this\u00c2\u00a0 promotional video clip below about Hyundai Genesis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Forward Attention Warning (FAW) system.  The narrator warns about \u00e2\u0080\u009csome situations in which FAW may not operate properly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for instance, if the driver is wearing polarized lenses, heavy eye makeup, or has their face obscured by their hair or a hat, or if the view is blocked by the position of the steering wheel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He concludes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember, the Forward Attention Warning system does not substitute for proper and safe driving. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the responsibility of the driver to always check the speed and distance to the vehicle ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So, although the system fails to fully monitor the driver, the carmaker can tick off the DMS box, save R&D expenses and pass the buck back to the lady in the car with glasses and a hat.
