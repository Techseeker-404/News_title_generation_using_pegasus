Although the comment did not come as a big shock to the automotive industry, Daimler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision exposed a hard and important reality: the development track for assisted driving is different from the development track for autonomous driving, and car OEMs are going to have to pick a lane. Vehicle manufacturers are under tremendous pressure to develop advanced driver-assistant systems (ADAS) and to create autonomous vehicles (AVs). The assumption that the former would lead to the latter persisted even as evidence accumulated that though ADAS and AV have parallels, the two are not directly related. \u00e2\u0080\u009cADAS and Autonomous have been, of necessity, on very different development paths, typically with different teams,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Ian Riches, executive director for the Global Automotive Practice at Strategy Analytics. And it is becoming apparent that most carmakers cannot afford to keep these parallel projects alive at the same time. The sorts of sensor suites, processing power and vehicle architectures required for autonomy are still way too expensive for mass-market ADAS features, Riches explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no easy way to scale-down an L4 architected-system to meet the cost points needed for standard-equipment, NCAP (New Car Assessment Program)-required features at present.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reverse is also true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stressed Riches.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe typically stand-alone, discrete architectures, modest processing power and limited sensor suites required by ADAS do not easily scale up to an L4 solution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Does this mean that no auto companies should plan to upgrade their ADAS cars of today to be L3, L4 and L5 AVs in the future? \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure anyone has truly been thinking that ADAS can evolve into autonomous.\u00c2\u00a0There have typically been completely separate development teams,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Riches reiterated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so far. (Source: Daimler)  In the chart above, Daimler talks about a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d gradual transition from ADAS to AV, even though there isn't such a singular path for product development.\u00c2\u00a0  In the current ADAS/AV development environment, leading automotive chip suppliers, whether Intel/Mobileye or NXP Semiconductors, have been pitching a variety of chips designed to proliferate ADAS features. Additionally, many of these semiconductor companies are promoting separate silicon solutions with beefed up processing power to target AVs. For example, Xilinx, which recently announced automotive-qualified 16-nm family devices, offers Zynq 7 (for L2 and L2+) and Zynq 11 (a single-chip domain controller designed for L2+ and above). The FPGA company is positioning both programmable chips to address everything from ADAS to in-cabin monitoring and automated driving, all of which are evolving rapidly. Incremental advances?  The question, then, becomes: Will ADAS development ever intersect with AV innovation? If it ever does, where and when? Phil Magney, for example, told EE Times that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that ADAS and robotaxis are mutually exclusive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIncremental automation is what Tesla is doing. You build up the fundamentals and collect as much data as you can.\u00c2\u00a0 Eventually you will have gained enough knowhow to apply it to robo-taxis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Magney is referring to Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-generation \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull self-driving car computer\u00e2\u0080\u009d equipped with two AI processors designed internally by Tesla. Riches is hopeful that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe cross-over point where a combined development team and approach may make sense is perhaps coming into sight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Riches\u00e2\u0080\u0099 opinion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe growing interest in so-called \u00e2\u0080\u0098L2+\u00e2\u0080\u0099 features could be the point that these two worlds start come together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis could emerge as an L4-style architected vehicle, with centralized control\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 but without the redundancy across sensors, processing and actuation to make it fully robust for L4 operation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But this still remains just a theory. Riches said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe optimist in me sees \u00e2\u0080\u0098L2+\u00e2\u0080\u0099as a way of bringing the maximum safety benefits to the widest audience as soon as possible.\u00c2\u00a0 The cynic in me sees it as a way of potentially finding some sort or ROI on \u00e2\u0080\u0098failed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 L4 development programs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two different design principles  Meanwhile, there are ongoing ADAS vs. AV debates in the industry. Safety experts and people with real-world experience running autonomous vehicles in cities claim that the two\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 designing a vehicle with a human driver in it and a car driven by no human driver\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 are worlds apart in their fundamental design principles. Carlos Holguin, Urban Mobility expert and a co-founder of AutoKAB, told EE Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the famous saying goes, \u00e2\u0080\u0098the electric light did not come from the continuous improvement of candles.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Better ADAS would not make a fully autonomous vehicle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In contrast, all chip suppliers have a vested interest in portraying their solutions as universally applicable from Level 2 ADAS to Level 4 highly automated vehicles. This is especially true if chip suppliers design more generic, highly programmable solutions such as GPU, FPGA and graph streaming processors (GSP). Nvidia, Xilinx and even some startups, notably Blaize, fall into that category. As Willard Tu, senior director, Xilinx\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Automotive Business Unit, explained to us, when ADAS and AV developers keep adding sensors such as 4D radars and lidars, the race among automotive chip suppliers boils down to one issue: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you stay ahead of the innovation game?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Blaize co-founder and CEO Dinakar Munagala also explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur clients keep coming back to tell us, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish your chip could do XYZ.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Munagala believes that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where his GSP could shine. He said that the GSP will be applied to intelligent telematics, ADAS, driver monitoring and occupant assessment. A single GSP architecture for many automotive applications is getting Blaize\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot in the door at OEMs and Tier Ones. As \u00e2\u0080\u009cintelligent\u00e2\u0080\u009d features keep rapidly evolving, the automotive industry wants a platform that extends from ADAS to AV.\u00c2\u00a0 Xilinx\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tu noted that although the industry has not converged on a common approach for an ADAS-to-AV transition, automakers are looking for thermally efficient programmable solutions that can accommodate the continuous innovation demanded by Euro NCAP, fast changing AI algorithms and flexibility in data pipeline to reduce AI latency.  (Source: Xilinx)  Confusion among automakers  The L2+ pitch by technology suppliers rose in volume in early 2019. Rather than promoting L4 as an end game, both automakers and chip suppliers have become increasingly vocal on the need for L2+. But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a news flash. Riches said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I think is undoubtedly true is that the consumer has yet to be truly consulted and has very little conception of how \u00e2\u0080\u0098L2+\u00e2\u0080\u0099 could be of benefit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He cautioned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutomakers need to ensure that they are not implementing technology for technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake but are indeed offering true user benefits at an affordable price.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
