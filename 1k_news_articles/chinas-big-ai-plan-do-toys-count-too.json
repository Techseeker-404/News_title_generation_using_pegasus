The lingering mystery, though, is how much of the best-laid plans of China will come to pass, if ever. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s State Council proposed in July 2017 \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It says that China will ultimately become the world leader in artificial intelligence, with a domestic AI industry worth almost $150 billion by 2030. The first step is to catch up with the United States on AI technology and applications by 2020. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to call this mere bravado, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not wise. As I see it, the Chinese genie is already out of the bottle. Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cnational champion\u00e2\u0080\u009d technology leaders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and iFlyTek \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are established, successful firms. They are leading the development of innovation platforms such as self-driving cars, smart cities, computer vision for medical diagnosis, and voice intelligence. The newest \u00e2\u0080\u009cnational champion\u00e2\u0080\u009d listed by Beijing is the Hong Kong startup SenseTime, which specializes in face- and image-recognition technology. Veteran reporters on the global IC beat remember a series of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfive-year plans\u00e2\u0080\u009d launched by the Chinese government a few decades ago, explicitly intended to kickstart an indigenous semiconductor industry. These early efforts resulted in the establishment of SMIC but not much else. Then in the 2010s, a host of Chinese chip startups sprang up, each designing its own SoCs with licensable cores from companies such as Arm and Ceva. To date, the Middle Kingdom, however, hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly cracked the global chip market, although China is now making an even bigger investment fund available for the domestic chip industry. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI plan and its big fund for the IC industry share common threads that include the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s huge budgets, aspirations, and ego. But the AI plan is likely to follow a path of its own because China already has established AI giants. Furthermore, the South China Morning Post, owned by Alibaba, claims that China now dominates AI funding. Last year, 48% of total equity funding of AI startups globally came from China, compared to a U.S. outlay of 38% and 13% by the rest of the world. This is a significant jump from China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 11.3% in 2016. The most convincing indication of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise in the AI market that I recently came across was the plethora of AI-driven toys displayed, demonstrated, and pitched at shop after shop in the Shenzhen airport. The toys range from battery-operated \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart\u00e2\u0080\u009d dogs and dancing programmable robots to conversational C3POs and interactive AI \u00e2\u0080\u009ceducational\u00e2\u0080\u009d robots with a remote \u00e2\u0080\u009cbabysitting\u00e2\u0080\u009d mode that takes snapshots of the kids and transmits them to Mom and Dad. AI-driven toy robots (Photo: EE Times)  You may laugh. After all, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only talking about toys whose AI capabilities are primitive. I laughed, too, until it dawned on me that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s booming toy business is the rare \u00e2\u0080\u0094 possibly exclusive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 example of making real money with AI. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ceducational\u00e2\u0080\u009d robots come with a level of intelligence equivalent to that of low-end smartphones. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presumptuous to judge these so-called AI-driven consumer goods as just toys. An interactive chatty robot with an AI system equipped with a range of English-language learning materials is a cheap shortcut to fluency for Chinese parents who want their kids to grow up and speak English. Even a robot whose conversation might seem a little dumb to a grownup doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother kids as long as the robots respond to them in an animated, interactive fashion. "}
