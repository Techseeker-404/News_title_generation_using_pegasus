The updates are not expected to delay commercial rollouts expected in the next few weeks and months, but they underscore the intensity of the engineering going on quietly in the background as carriers race to turn on their first 5G networks. The 3GPP marked the eight change requests released this month as non-backwards-compatible. So carriers and their suppliers will have to agree on whether they will standardize on the 3GPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5G spec released at its June 2018 plenary, the new spec from the September plenary, or a hybrid. The changes come at a time when carriers are already deploying and testing infrastructure that will make up commercial offerings. In parallel, handset makers are finishing work on smartphones supporting the wide variety of bands, from 600 MHz to 39 GHz, expected to be used by 5G services turning on before April. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have not announced which version [of the 3GPP spec] our products will be based on \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 these changes are relevant to both base stations and [handsets], but there is no need for any new chipsets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lorenzo Casaccia, who oversees 3GPP standards work for Qualcomm. The eight changes are all marked ASN.1, which means that they are at the software layer, said Casaccia. At least five of the eight are marked as coming from 3GPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RAN-2 group that typically defines functions implemented in software, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo spec is bug-free \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I can guarantee that there will still be small corrections in the next version of the spec; however, we are reasonably confident that there will not be any critical ones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, suggesting that most carriers and suppliers will probably base initial rollouts on the September spec. A representative of one other chip company who asked not to be named agreed that the latest 3GPP changes could be handled in software or firmware.

As part of the rush to market, the 3GPP \u00e2\u0080\u009ctried to push the [5G New Radio] spec too quickly, targeting December of last year, and as a side effect, a lot of change requests are coming through. People thought that all of the non-backwards-compatible ones would be finished in June.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   A list of eight 5G spec changes that the 3GPP released this month. Click to enlarge.
