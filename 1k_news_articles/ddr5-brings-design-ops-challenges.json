The JESD79-5 DDR5 SDRAM standard, published by the JEDEC Solid State Technology Association earlier this year, was designed to meet increasing needs for efficient performance in a wide range of applications including client systems and high-performance servers. The latter segment is facing increasingly more performance pressures from intensive cloud and enterprise data center applications. Overall, the DDR5 specification provides developers with twice the performance and much improved power efficiency in comparison to DDR4. More specifically, the DDR5 standard is architected to improve scaling performance without degrading channel efficiency at higher speeds, which has been achieved by doubling the burst length to BL16 and bank-count to 32 from 16. JEDEC describes the DDR5 architecture as \u00e2\u0080\u009crevolutionary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in that it provides better channel efficiency and higher application-level performance that will enable the continued evolution of next-generation computing systems. For increased reliability and efficiency, a DDR5 DIMM boasts two 40-bit fully independent sub-channels on the same module. Despite the significant leaps forward from DDR4, DDR5 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean a radical change for designers, said Jim Handy, principal analyst with Objective Analysis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince the first DDR, reference designs have been used for all board layouts, and every part of the memory subsystem has to go through validation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That includes everything from connectors to DIMMs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the time it gets to the design engineer it will all be proven out, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no difference between DDR4 and DDR5 from a design perspective.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not many designers need to choose between the two either, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat decision was made by the processor manufacturer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One processor may require the use of DDR4, while the other may require DDR5. Other than processor architects, the only people in position to choose are those who design their own FPGAs and ASICs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot very many of those designs use DRAM.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Handy said the most notable aspect of DDR5 is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even faster than DDR4, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich was already awfully fast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d JEDEC describes the DDR5 architecture as \u00e2\u0080\u009crevolutionary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d providing developers with twice the performance and much improved power efficiency, compared to DDR4. (Image source: JEDEC) DRAM maker Micron Technology sees few challenges with the move to DDR5, said Micron Lead Architect Frank Ross, although moving voltage regulation from the system to the DIMM will take some getting used to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u2019s great advantages for us having that on the DIMM and simplifying the motherboard and improving the power delivery network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The challenges posed by differences between DDR4 and DDR5 aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t steep ones, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time we go to these kinds of faster speeds, especially the speeds that we\u2019re looking at for DDR5, there\u2019ll be some new challenges for making sure the signaling is good, and that comes from both the system design and motherboard design side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There will be a lot of new training algorithms that will need to be developed, said Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u2019ll be an adjustment for everybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The training required is a reminder that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot involved in simply doubling the speed of DRAM from one iteration to the next, he said, but that all the work to enable the improvements of DDR5 have been with the intent to make sure the specification has a long run well into the future, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why reliability is critical. Densities are beginning at 16Gb and eventually 32Gb, with an interim step of 24 likely, said Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe big deal for us since this was going to last for a long time was making sure that we were going to be addressing the DRAM scaling going forward, so we really had to look very closely at reliability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From a use-case scenario, reliability is critical as a great deal of DRAM demand is coming from data centers that support enterprise-class private and public clouds, which continue to grow at a rapid pace and where initial update of DDR5 is expected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to make sure we\u2019re providing the kind of reliability that\u2019s going to operate at scale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said doubling the bandwidth is only part of the story when it comes to performance improvements; efficiencies such as better bus utilization is also a benefit of DDR5. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to keep that data bus constantly utilized.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By having more banks available to the system to refresh operations concurrent to data accesses, DDR5 offers a huge performance gainer over DDR4, he said.
