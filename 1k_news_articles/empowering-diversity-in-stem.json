We aim to attract and actively support a more diverse and innovative American workforce \u00c2\u00a0for power electronics including entrepreneurs and their startups. A key element of this mission is PEIC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly established Diversity & Inclusion Working Group, chartered with developing outreach programs aimed at under-represented demographic groups. A number of recent studies, such as this McKinsey Report, assert that diverse and inclusive teams are more creative, providing their companies with a competitive advantage, which, in turn, leads to better financial results. Many companies have established policies to promote diversity in their hiring practices and encourage more inclusivity in the workplace. However, given recent NSF statistics, there remains more to be done. An Atlassian 2017 State of Diversity Report estimates that blacks represent only about 2% of the tech workforce, Hispanics 3%, and 24% identify as female. Yet, in spite of these statistics, the survey also reports that 83% of respondents say their company is already diverse, and 79% think the average team at their companies has a diverse set of team members. To reflect the U.S. population which is approximately 64% white, 17% Hispanic, 12% black, and 6% Asian; a typical tech project team with 10 members would theoretically be expected to have five women and five men; six members of the team would be white, one black, two Latino, and one Asian. This scenario not only looks quite unfamiliar to most of us in the tech workforce, but moreover, it is statistically impossible for 79% of the survey respondents to be on project teams with anything like this level of diversity. In my personal experience, the most successful and innovative product development team I worked on was also one of the most diverse in terms of racial makeup and male/female mix. Of course, diversity alone is not enough to guarantee success \u00e2\u0080\u0093 without a spirit of inclusion, there can be division instead of innovation.\u00c2\u00a0 The American psyche has always involved a tension between the vision of a country built on rugged individualism (diversity), and the virtues of its success as a melting pot nation (inclusion). In many ways, the tech industry epitomizes these dueling ideals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it celebrates (and provides funding for) daring risktakers on the new frontier of technology, but it also struggles to reward, or sometimes even acknowledge, the instrumental contributions of hidden figures who work behind the scenes. For example, Elizebeth Smith Friedman helped to invent the science of cryptology. Her extraordinary code breaking skills helped to end World War I, catch international smugglers, and later thwart Nazi spies during WWII. During the space race, Katherine Goble Johnson spent her career calculating the rocket trajectories for NASA. John Glen famously requested that she do the reentry calculations before his first orbit of the earth in 1962. Women and people of color have made countless contributions in STEM-related fields throughout history, and even more so during the 20th  century, yet many stereotypes and myths persist\u2013especially in terms of aptitude and ability, despite their record of leadership and innovation. Government and corporate policies can only take us so far. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the grassroots level where real change can happen. Imagine if every technical team in the industry were to hire and train an additional, modestly compensated intern or apprentice selected for attributes that cannot be taught\u2013passion for tech, a can-do attitude and intellectual curiosity. Such an approach would inevitably cast a wider net, attracting a more motivated and diverse set of applicants, compared to the current emphasis on pedigree education, previous work experience or current skill level.\u00c2\u00a0 Ultimately, the overall talent pool would be elevated in both skill and diversity. PEIC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Diversity & Inclusion Working Group will advocate for these types of programs and other innovative ways to diversify our industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workforce. On behalf of PEIC, we invite technical workers and management involved with power conversion technologies to join us. Nanci Vogtli  was recently named as acting president of the Power Electronics Industry Collaborative (PEIC) board of directors. She also  is  founder of Concrete Logic,  a technology consulting firm specializing in the cleantech hardware industry.  "}
