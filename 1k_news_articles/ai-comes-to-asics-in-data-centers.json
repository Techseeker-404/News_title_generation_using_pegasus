That ASIC expert was eSilicon. Two industry sources independently told EE Times that eSilicon worked on Nervana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI ASIC and delivered it to Intel after the startup was sold. eSilicon, however, declined to comment on its customer. Nervana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first-generation AI ASIC, called Lake Crest, was one of the most-watched custom designs for AI accelerators. Leveraging its own cumulative work with the customer on the design of AI/2.5D systems, Santa Clara, California-based eSilicon rolled out this week a machine-learning AI platform called \u00e2\u0080\u009cneuASIC.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The platform includes \u00e2\u0080\u009ca library of AI-targeted functions that can be quickly combined and configured to create custom AI algorithm accelerators,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained eSilicon. A novice AI chip designer could be advised to lean on someone like eSilicon just as Nervana did. After all, the ASIC expert could give some comfort and solid technology foothold in AI ASICs backed by its own real-world experience. With many companies planning AI chips optimized for certain AI workloads, their biggest roadblock is the constant state of change in AI algorithms. As Patrick Soheili, vice president of business and corporate development at eSilicon, noted, everyone knows that ASICs provide the best power and performance for AI acceleration. But an incautious designer could end up with a static ASIC that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsolete on arrival. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where eSilicon hopes to come in. By using such tools as a Design Profiler and AI Engine Explorer, a variety of IP \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some developed by eSilicon and others from third parties \u00e2\u0080\u0094 available on the neuASIC platform can be configured as \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI tiles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained the company. By turning a knob on eSilicon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tools, customers can do early power, performance, and area analysis of various candidate architectures, noted Soheili. Knowing the functions that need to be added and customized, Soheili said that eSilicon can add them as AI titles to the neuASIC platform. This will offer eSilicon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers much-needed flexibility. In short, the neuASIC platform provides a scalable, configurable ASIC chassis with swappable AI tiles, according to eSilicon. eSilicon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ASIC chassis offers scalable ASIC architecture Click here for larger image.

He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still left up to the customer to know how to architect something novel from those building blocks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
