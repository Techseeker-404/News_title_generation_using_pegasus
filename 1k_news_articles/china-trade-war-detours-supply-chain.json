Procurement costs have increased; partnerships have been severed; and companies have been forced to relocate manufacturing. Global procurement operations are shifting away from China-reliant suppliers.   President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs were initially seen as a blunt instrument that would force other countries to drop their trade barriers. Nearly a year into the U.S.-China trade war, tech companies are accepting constant supply uncertainty as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe new normal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Morey Factory, based in Southwest Chicago, makes sub-assemblies for automotive, aero/defense, and industrial OEMs. (Source: Morey) \u00e2\u0080\u009cTen months ago, we were concerned about the first round of tariffs, but when we saw the actual impact, we could almost brush it off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Whittier, president and COO of U.S. electronics design and manufacturing firm Morey Corp. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the October time frame, it started to become more serious, and we were implementing plans to discharge tariffs to our customers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morey, like many U.S. manufacturers, relies on imported resistors, capacitors, and printed circuit boards (PCBs). It is one of thousands of companies actively seeking alternatives for tariffed or scarce devices. So far, tariffs have affected procurement costs, product design, and production timing. With 25% tariffs now levied on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, OEMs may have to consider redesigning their products. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think this is the new normal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whittier said. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible, economists say, that the tariffs will never go away. That could have an upside for an industry that spent most of 2018 forging new supply networks. Institute for Supply Management CEO Tom Derry said that the supply chain will emerge more agile for its tariff travails. Manufacturers have a chance to differentiate themselves from China-reliant competitors. The downside, however, may be irreversible. Procurement costs have increased; partnerships have been severed; and companies have been forced to relocate manufacturing. Global procurement operations are shifting away from China-reliant suppliers. One U.S. component maker, faced with rising expenses, split with its Chinese factories and is now outsourcing in Japan. Another supplier is targeting competitors that build in China to give customers a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-tariff option\u00e2\u0080\u009d for passive and electromechanical components. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of this is helping, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge distraction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whittier said.  Recommended   China vs. U.S.: Cold War of 21st Century?   A tangled web China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the electronics supply chain can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be understated. Component manufacturers have opened factories and/or outsourced production there. OEMs and EMS providers have done likewise and procured the bulk of their bills of material in China. Electronics distributors source, and then warehouse, large volumes of devices produced on the Mainland. The most recent round of Chinese tariffs has heightened Morey Corp.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns.    George Whittier  So far, Whittier said, there hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been a cost that Morey couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t manage. But a 25% tax on many products could be a game-changer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause we already have contracts with customers, they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be harmed [by the increase],\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think they \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or we \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are going to spend a lot more time redesigning things. The major impact will be in PCBs, which is one of the biggest costs we have. More than 50% of PCBs are manufactured in China.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morey supports businesses in the automotive, aerospace/defense, commercial, and industrial markets. Customers must approve a departure from their approved vendor list. Noting that vetting new suppliers is time-consuming undersells the severity of the consequences \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it could cause production delays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are heavily engaged in alternative sources,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whittier explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if [many] manufacturers decide not to source from China, there could be a sudden shortage of PCBs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In some cases, he added, there are no alternative options. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest modem companies produce 100% of their products in China. If those are spec\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little chance that [customers] will use someone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Suppliers have been upfront about passing tariff costs onto customers. Expenses aside, the trade war has caused a lot of non-value-added work for electronics companies. Distributors must identify components subject to tariffs and pass that information along to their customers. Electronics trade associations have pushed back against tariffs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn [mid-May], the U.S. and China have followed through on threats to raise tariffs on more imports from one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s countries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stated the IPC, a PCB trade group. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese tariffs are affecting the global electronics supply chain, increasing costs and uncertainties for companies seeking to remain competitive in the global marketplace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d New trade barriers will harm both countries, IPC added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe urge U.S. and Chinese officials to accelerate negotiations and finalize an agreement that addresses long-standing disagreements, including intellectual property and market access.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Managing through the uncertainty For the past nine months, the channel has helped customers mitigate the impact of tariffs and realign their supply chains. Several distributors established \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree trade zones\u00e2\u0080\u009d for purchasing transactions. Still, customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bills of material typically call for hundreds of component SKUs. Since the implementation of the China Tariff List 301 in July 2018, authorized distributors are challenged with managing, processing, and sharing their suppliers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tariff information, the Electronics Components Industry Association (ECIA) said. The trade group has developed a template for exchanging critical data. The guideline represents what distributors consider the best practices for suppliers handling tariffs.  Source: ECIA The damage is done Even if the U.S. and China reach a trade pact, the impact of the trade war won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t abate. Businesses have established new supply networks that are difficult to dislodge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem, the way I see it, is that both countries are so entwined with each other in this global market that we have that only the largest of the largest companies are able to diversify themselves out of a leveraged position,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Reuben Townsend, director at Nano Components Pty Ltd in Australia. As the U.S. and China duke it out, he said, the victors will be countries like India, Malaysia, and Japan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn electronics and production in electronics, both in components and manufacturing/assembly, we will find huge issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Townsend said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just coming out of a shortage crisis, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put the industry on the back foot for the past two years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The latest round of tariffs, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas the real potential to put pricing of electronics and goods with any kind of electronics in them into the stratosphere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morey Corp. has decided to look for a silver lining. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith news around the latest round of tariffs that will be assessed on almost everything, I look at this as a huge opportunity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Whittier. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of our competitors buy or build in China. If we do a redesign that can improve our cost position, I see that as a competitive advantage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come full circle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis could be a net positive for our company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Check out all the stories inside this Special Project:      Tech Warfare Outbreak Hits China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI  Economist Dieter Ernst tells us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe damage done by this outbreak of open technology warfare is likely to be much more serious and long-lasting than normally assumed in the media.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    U.S.-China Trade Damages Done Despite trade negotiations that dragged on for months, the only discernible result was confirmation that \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncertainty\u00e2\u0080\u009d will indefinitely rule the future of the electronics industry and its markets.
