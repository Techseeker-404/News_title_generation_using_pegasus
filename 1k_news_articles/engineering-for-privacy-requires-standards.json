The related EU-wide Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) will open up customer transactions and data to third parties with appropriate consent.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 Methods and common practices to meet these requirements are not established yet, a potential roadblock for product developers. The Kantara Initiative is working to address this challenge with its recently launched Consent Management Solutions Work Group. \u00c2\u00a0iWelcome and digi.me, pioneers in what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called the consent market, are leading the work group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to provide a guideline document around privacy policies. They eventually hope to craft standards with a certification program. Regulations mandate consent must be explicit and informed.\u00c2\u00a0 The question is though how to do that in a way that works for individuals. Recent iWelcome research on GDPR readiness found that only 20 percent of Europe\u2019s most prominent organisations are on the right track. The vast majority\u201380 percent of the organisations\u00e2\u0080\u0094were either just starting or have not yet started becoming GDPR-compliant at all. The Kantara group aims to review best practices and thoughts on the issues to derive standards that can fill the gaps. All outputs from the work group will be non-proprietary and designed to help people meet the new regulations around personal identity and privacy information.\u00c2\u00a0 New consent and privacy-aware techniques may open up new job opportunities. Some expect an explosion in demand for such expertise. The GDPR applies to employees as well as end users. Engineers and their companies will need to deploy consent management solutions and best practices for internal use, as well as for services they sell. Companies must ensure contracts state the purpose of collecting and processing personal data, who the data will be shared with, for what reason and for how long.\u00c2\u00a0 Firms will need to know where personal data is held, who is processing it and ask for employee consent for these purposes. As our identities and personal data become primarily digital, they will become a recognized currency with real value to both consumers and businesses.\u00c2\u00a0 Engineers and their companies have a real opportunity to capitalize on this digital transformation, but they will need to know and implement clear guidelines. \u2014 Colin Wallis is the executive director of the Kantara Initiative.
