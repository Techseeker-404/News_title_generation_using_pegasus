According to a Keysight statement, the four main buildings are intact, though modular buildings suffered damage. The Santa Rosa facility at 1400 Fountaingrove Parkway is temporarily closed. Some local news reports inaccurately stated that Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buildings had been destroyed. Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s facility is located in an evacuation zone. The following image, posted on the Santa Rosa Fire Department website, shows Fountaingrove Parkway in the center of the larger evacuation zone (click to enlarge).  A curfew in the evacuation zones, posted on the City of Santa Rosa Fire Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Facebook page, was in effect until 7:15 a.m. PDT today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy heart aches when I see the destruction caused by the Santa Rosa fire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former HP/Agilent employee Larry Desjardin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeveral friends have lost their homes, and entire neighborhoods have been destroyed in one night of violent fury. The house I lived in is gone. I pray that the fires will be quickly contained so that the rebuilding of lives and neighborhoods can begin shortly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We, at EE Times, hope that the damage to Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters is minimal and that employees who suffered as a result of the fires will be back on their feet soon. \u00e2\u0080\u0094Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
