The partners, which also include Qualcomm and Vedecom, a public-private R&D institute based in France, have been demonstrating their DEVC technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009celectronic road\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 on a specially built test track as part of the FABRIC project in Versailles, France. The demo, which is based on Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HALO technology, showed that vehicle batteries can be charged at up to 20kW while travelling at up to 100km/h down the track.  Speakers Robert Lassartesses and Antoine Caillierez of Renault explained that the issues with current electric vehicle charging technologies mean they could never meet users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations in terms of speed and convenience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you compare [today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s] fast charging with gasoline, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not equivalent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lassartesses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven in our best dreams [EV charging] is 300kW. We are 20 times below what you can do with gasoline and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to keep this in mind. Equivalent service between electricity and [traditional] fuel cannot be expected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Renault\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figures showed that with current 400V batteries the typical charging power is around 140kW. Using an 800V battery makes 300kW charging possible, Lassartesses said, but that battery would be very heavy. To meet European drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 requirements of a two hour, 250km range at 140km/h from a single 15-minute charge would require a battery weighing 700kg, obviously unsuitable for the majority of the market in Europe, which is for small to medium sized BEVs (battery electric vehicles).  Earlier charging alternatives put forward by Renault have had mixed success. QuickDrop, proposed in 2009, involves pulling in at a service station where a machine removes the battery from the car and physically swaps it with a fully charged one. While this process takes only a few minutes, the idea was abandoned due to business model issues. More successful was hydrogen fuel cell range extender technology, which is on the market today in some of Renault\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kangoo vans. The technology Renault is currently backing for the future of BEVs is the electric road, whereby vehicles are charged as they move along the road by mains-connected infrastructure buried in the tarmac, with either a conductive (wired) or wireless connection to the vehicle. Crucially, this allows small vehicles to run for long distances at high speed with only small, lightweight batteries.  The test track built by Vedecom, Renault and Qualcomm as part of the EU-funded FABRIC project has demonstrated DEVC under real-world highway conditions. Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HALO system uses 50cm coils of wire buried in the road which are inductively coupled to similar coils in the vehicles as they pass overhead. Since the vehicle coils pass over the ground coils at speed, and there is a significant air gap, coupling efficiency is relatively low, meaning a resonant power supply topology must be used to compensate. Underground coils either side of the one actively charging a vehicle at any moment in time must be held at short circuit to ensure only one coil charges each BEV at a time. These coils can currently be switched on and off within 4ms, though Renault\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Caillierez insisted that this could be improved. There is still also optimization to be done in terms of the magnetics and packaging of the coils in the roadway, Caillierez said. Regarding the economic challenges of installing this infrastructure on a country-wide scale, Lassartesses presented the findings of a study carried out by Renault alongside French electricity supplier EDF and French highway operator SANEF. This study put the cost of installing wireless dynamic electric vehicle charging at around 4 million euros per km of highway (for both directions of travel). This cost breaks down to 35 percent for works to the national grid, 55 percent for the electronics and coils and 15 percent for roadworks. The total cost to install the system across all French toll highways (9000km) is around 40 billion euro, or 2 billion euro a year spread across 20 years. Even with increased highway tolls to cover some of this investment, the study showed that the cost per kilometer of highway driving was cheaper for small battery (50kWh) BEVs using wireless dynamic charging compared to driving large battery (130kWh) BEVs with existing charging methods. Lassartesses also highlighted the potential for substantial reductions in CO2 emissions as a result of wireless direct charging. Lassartesses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 closing remarks highlighted Renault\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view that electric road technology is currently the leading solution for the future of BEV charging. However, he pointed out that while dynamic wireless charging has now been proven on a full scale test track, there is still a lot of work to do before it can be deployed in real roads. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndustry partners need to organize themselves to focus on the best technology, conductive or wireless, for all users. We need a solution for everybody: trucks, coaches and cars,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDue to the huge investment required for highway deployment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at 40 billion euro for only one country \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the European Commission and member states need to secure the business model in order to extend the experimentation with industrial partners to a larger scale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
