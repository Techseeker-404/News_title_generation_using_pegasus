The displacements of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s machine-learning era will happen within 15 to 20 years and will be dramatic. In 2030 to 2035, smart robots will replace 500 million to a billion workers in manufacturing and construction. A similar displacement will occur in service industries during the same time frame. The good news is the industrial revolution produced many new industries. AI will be similar, with the need for new skills and extensive training. The key building block functions of machine learning are processors and algorithms that allow specific tasks to be efficiently implemented. The essence of AI is analysis of data and extraction of value from data. Data is generated from multiple sources, and as AI algorithms become more powerful, they will be able to create new data from existing data.   AI will see rapid improvements in algorithms and accelerators.   Click to enlarge. (Source: International Business Strategies, Inc.)   The thousand-fold increase in processor performance (predicted above) will be due to the migration to 2nm and smaller features as well as new architectures. The new architectures, some already emerging, will be based on embedding many heterogeneous as well as homogenous processor cores and supporting memory blocks in close proximity to the processor cores. Enhancements in algorithms are also expected to result in a thousand-fold improvement in analytics capabilities. Leadership capabilities already are emerging from DeepMind and others. The AI-based algorithms will be specific to various applications, with the ability to learn as more data is processed. The amount of data being generated and processed at the edge and in the cloud will increase almost exponentially as 5G becomes available and as the IoT infrastructure is established. Smartphones will become superphones, and the virtual twin concept of superphones being an extension of the human brain will obsolete many tasks that currently done by people. Handsets will not need human intervention within the supply chain for many of the blockchain-based tasks. Elsewhere, the medical field will see significant improvements in disease prevention and treatment, and the food supply chain will also experience dramatic changes. For its part, education system will need to be completely overhauled by the processing power advances in AI-based devices. The semiconductor and electronics industries will have many high-growth opportunities. Systems will need higher-performance and lower-power processors, additional memory capacity, and very large data storage capacity. Corporations and countries that develop effective strategies to address the challenges and opportunities related to AI and machine learning can experience strong growth. Those that do not adapt risk becoming obsolete. My new book \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI + IA\u00e2\u0080\u009d details the impact of machine learning on China in 2025 to 2030, but many of the conclusions also apply to other countries, including the U.S. The book provides inputs on what must be done to build new industries as well as the risks of not having effective long-term strategies. China is making a major commitment to AI, and while resources will not be used effectively in some areas, the net impact is expected to be positive in 2025 to 2030. \u00c2\u00a0U.S. corporations need to take a long-term approach to the China market and be part of the global growth of industries that adopt AI and machine learning. \u2013Handel Jones is chief executive of International Business Strategies and author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI + IA\u00e2\u0080\u009d (China Machine Press) as well as \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Globalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2014).
