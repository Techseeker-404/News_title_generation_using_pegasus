To accelerate radar integration in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), NXP rolled out Tuesday (Oct. 2) a radar solution combining its S32R processors, RF transceiver and antenna design on a new reference platform. Developed in\u00c2\u00a0partnership with Colorado Engineering, the platform meets \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe stringent functional, performance, and safety requirements of the industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d claimed NXP. Integrated sensors in a vehicle (Source: NXP Semiconductors)  The new system was designed to demystify the intricate \u00e2\u0080\u009cart\u00e2\u0080\u009d of radar that typically requires big automotive OEMs to fine-tune antenna and analog designs. NXP hopes that its \u00e2\u0080\u009cout-of-the-box\u00e2\u0080\u009d automotive radar system can serve Chinese car OEMs who still need several years to catch up with automotive incumbents in the rest of the world. In a recent phone interview with EE Times, Kamal Khouri,\u00c2\u00a0vice president and general manager for ADAS at NXP told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRadar has become the sensor of choice\u00e2\u0080\u009d to enable ACC and AEB. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCameras can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t measure velocity, while radars can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy bouncing off signals, radars can also see around the corner. On the other hand, lidars that use no moving parts are still very expensive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, it is well known that traditional radar lacks resolution and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t distinguish nearby objects. Radars are also notorious for sounding false alarms and they consistently fail to process information fast enough to be helpful on the highway. Khouri made clear that NXP does not believe radars will replace cameras. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe combination of cameras and imaging radars offers redundancy, thus making vehicles safer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Khouri said. Inside new radar solution So, what does NXP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new radar solution entail? The reference design, dubbed RDK-S32R274, combines NXP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s S32R27 processor, TEF810x CMOS transceiver, FS8410 power management IC and a radar software development kit. NXP has added expansion and antenna modules that can be optimized to create a customized development platform for specific customer applications. At the heart of the radar solution sits a scalable family of Power Architecture-based processors\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 S32R27 and S32R37\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 which Khouri described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first chips dedicated to processing radar algorithms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   NXP's S32R block diagram (Source: NXP) "}
