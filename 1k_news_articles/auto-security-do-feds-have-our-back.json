We now know that what used to be considered a movie scenario \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0remote hacking \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0could be done. The current reality is that, while a variety of connectivity technologies have been transfused into cars, the equal and opposite security measures are yet to be deployed. Surely, car hacking is the last thing automakers want to mention as they push the connected cars into the vast consumer disconnect. But government watchdogs in both the U.S. and the U.K. are working to get ahead of the curve and let the public know that they are concerned.  \u201cWhether we\u2019re turning vehicles into WiFi-connected hotspots or equipping them with millions of lines of code to become fully automated, it is important that they are protected against cyber-attacks,\u201d said Martin Callanan, a minister in the Department for Transport at the British government. He said this last week when the U.K. agency issued new guidelines, requiring manufacturers of Internet-connected vehicles to put in place tougher cyber protections to ensure a stronger shield against hackers. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just the U.K. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States also issued last fall the federal guidance to the automotive industry for improving motor vehicle cybersecurity. Questions to ask So should we all sleep well, confident that the feds have our back? Not so fast, Gracie. Questions that come to my mind include: 1.\u00c2\u00a0Do the guidelines issued by NHTSA and British Department of Transportation have any teeth for security enforcement?  2.\u00c2\u00a0More important, have they gone far enough to suggest effective cybersecurity measures for cars? 3.\u00c2\u00a0What are the differences in the proposals of the two separate governments? As Roger Lanctot, director automotive connected mobility in the global automotive practice at Strategy Analytics, told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of the work and guidance today is advisory vs. compulsory in nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Things will become real, in his opinion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen financial and liability consequences are in fact defined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sources of vulnerability in connected cars are many. Lanctot listed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiagnostic ports, hobbyist/enthusiasts, dealers, suppliers/supply chain, criminals and terrorists to say nothing of incompetence, bugs, and the management of multiple onboard systems crossing domains with different development standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Facing so many areas inside cars that must be protected as cars morph into always-on computing devices, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy to come up with comprehensive guidelines. And yet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRegulators need to demonstrate they are doing something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lanctot. How do security experts see the development of government guidelines? Gene Carter, vice president of products at OnBoard Security, for example, believes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cboth the U.K. and NHTSA guidance documents included basic security tenets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He explained such measures should be followed by any company connecting hardware or software to the web \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0including security by design, defense in depth, principles of least privilege, etc.\u00c2\u00a0 In Carter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion, however, these are basics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would hope that the automakers have learned enough from the IT world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences, and they [should be] already doing those essential things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A few experts, including Carter, pointed out that the U.K.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidance does not go far enough in the area of software updates after a vulnerability is discovered. Carter said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe guidance merely states\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0098organizations plan for how to maintain\u00c2\u00a0security over the lifetime of their systems.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his view, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver The Air (OTA) updates should be a requirement for automobiles.\u00c2\u00a0 It is impossible for a manufacturer to create a car that is free of vulnerabilities throughout the 10-20 year life of a car.\u00c2\u00a0 Without OTA, automakers are relying on car owners to bring their cars into a repair show every time a new vulnerability is discovered.\u00c2\u00a0 This will leave many cars exposed to known attacks, while OTA would allow the fix to be pushed to the at-risk vehicles immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, car makers \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill save a lot of money in recalls by offering OTA, so it is\u00c2\u00a0likely they will move to that technology on their own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Carter. Still, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have\u00c2\u00a0preferred the UK specify its use and not leave it so\u00c2\u00a0ambiguous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, David Barzilai, chairman and co-founder of automotive cybersecurity firm Karamba Security, weighed in on the U.K. government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidance. While applauding pre-emptive action they might take, he pointed out that there is one area \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel these guidelines go far enough toward effectively preventing car hacking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\u00a0 Again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the area of how to deal with security bugs.
