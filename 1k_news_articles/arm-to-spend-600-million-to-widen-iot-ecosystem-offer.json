This follows its acquisition in June of Stream Technologies, a unified connectivity management platform for IoT devices, and its investment in San Jose-based SWIM.ai. The latest acquisition news is from people close to the deal, according to Bloomberg. We contacted Arm for a comment and will update this story if we receive a response. Arm is expected to make a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmajor IoT announcement\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Aug. 7, according to its spokesperson, so this acquisition sounds like it could form the basis of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play into a wider IoT ecosystem offering. Acquiring a data company and a connectivity platform might, at first, sound odd for a microprocessor company. But for Arm and others in the semiconductor industry, the challenge is increasingly about how to be perceived to be higher up in the value chain, to be part of the system solution rather than just be a vendor of a piece of intellectual property or just one part of the puzzle in the whole system. I often hear from traditional silicon IP vendors that they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just be selling their bit of the system but need to be selling a solution to create more value and also better revenue opportunities and profitability. In the case of Arm, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management must be in no doubt that the route to profitability has to be this bigger ecosystem sell, and hence, the acquisition strategy would make sense. Stream, for example, provides the physical connectivity platform for IoT networks covering several wireless protocols. At the time of acquisition, it is said to have been maintaining 770,000 managed subscribers and handling 2 TB of traffic per day. Stream provides companies with the ability to deploy an IoT device, find a network, self-authenticate, automatically provision, and connect to the lowest-cost channel, removing the need to interface with multiple different network systems and develop several business contracts for the network connectivity. In its press statement on the Stream acquisition, Arm said that, together with its Mbed IoT device management platform, the combination will provide organizations with a scalable end-to-end IoT platform for managing, connecting, provisioning and updating devices. In addition, Stream is also expected to work with mobile industry association GSMA to create compliant embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) solutions to ensure secure identity and optimal connectivity for IoT devices from the chip to the cloud. Treasure Data \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whose customers include SoftBank, the owner of Arm \u00e2\u0080\u0094 already provides data analytics solutions for automotive and IoT for firms like Pioneer, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. It says that it can ingest data from any connected device or machine, correlate data from multiple sources, and leverage machine learning to enable customers to act on the insights provided. It was founded by three Japanese entrepreneurs in California in 2011 and has received over $54 million in funding to date. In another piece of the puzzle, Arm also made a strategic investment in SWIM.ai as part of a $10 million round with U.K.-based Cambridge Innovation Capital. The company provides edge-based intelligence software running in a mesh fabric architecture. Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal data scientist, Damon Civin, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSWIM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to analyze data and apply machine learning at the edge unlocks new IoT use cases by unleashing data that was previously too difficult, slow, or expensive to send to the cloud for analysis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So if the Treasure Data acquisition does end up being confirmed, not only would it be on of Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest acquisitions to date (the biggest was Artisan Components in 2004) but it would also play into the strategy of adding the relevant parts of the puzzle to enable it to provide the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbigger-picture\u00e2\u0080\u009d ecosystem sell.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nitin Dahad is a European correspondent for EE Times.
