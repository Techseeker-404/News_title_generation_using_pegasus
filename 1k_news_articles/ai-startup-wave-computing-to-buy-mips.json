The move will allow Wave Computing to expand from AI training in data centers to AI inference for embedded systems. EE Times called Wave Computing's CEO Derek Meyer, and asked him what has motivated the startup to make such a move. He told EE Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur strategy has always been to push our dataflow fabric out to the edge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The acquisition should give Wave Computing an opportunity to infuse its scalable dataflow technology with MIPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RISC processors while plugging it into MIPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ecosystem. Bold move  An AI startup with just 100 employees acquiring another company of equal size \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with long history and deep roots in the tech community \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a rare coup. Several industry analysts called Wave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move \u00e2\u0080\u009cbold\u00e2\u0080\u009d and noted that the decision could help elevate the buyer in the AI market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is bold for a small startup to think this big, to reach for market extension before their first product is out,\u201d said Karl Freund, lead analyst for HPC and Deep Learning at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cRisky, perhaps, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what it takes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d MIPS isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just any old company, though. Despite its diminsihed position in the processor core IP market, MIPS architecture still has numerous supporters and nostalgic believers. More importantly, a broad range of customers is sticking with MIPS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Microchip, Mobileye (now an Intel company), MediaTek, and Denso, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading tier one. MIPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DNA  Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, noted that Wave Computing and MIPS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both partly underwritten by Dado Banatao, managing partner of Tallwood Venture Capital \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have \u00e2\u0080\u009ca natural affinity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Derek Meyer "}
