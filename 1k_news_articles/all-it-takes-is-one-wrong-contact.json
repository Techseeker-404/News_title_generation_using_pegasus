Every time I leave the house, I remind myself of that. It takes just one wrong contact by one unmasked person, known or unknown to me, standing too close and breathing on me. Just one, and I could get Covid-19. Weirdly enough, this isn\u2019t so different from industrial cybersecurity. In coronavirus America, all it takes is one wrong contact, because it\u2019s not only about who I touch. It\u2019s about who they\u2019ve touched, and who they\u2019ve touched, since we don\u2019t know who\u2019s infected, who\u2019s a carrier, and we still don\u2019t have universal testing. So I mask up, wear gloves, avoid getting too close to others, and use hand sanitizer as soon as I get back in the car. There\u2019s a similar routine when I get home.  Recommended  As Remote Workers Expand, So Do Cloud Cybersecurity Problems   We\u2019re All Amateurs By now, the protocol for interacting with others outside our own household to avoid getting this disease is well known. It\u2019s not a matter of technology, not yet anyway without universal testing, let alone a vaccine. It all rests on behavior, on best practices, to avoid giving or getting the Covid-19 potential killer. And we rely on those best practices even though we\u2019re all amateurs, not trained medical professionals. Forget anything, and you could already be infected, but not know it. Potential disaster in the world of industrial cyberattacks could be your manufacturing line being interrupted, as happened to Honda in June. Hackers may try to compromise your network, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to it, your IT or operational technology (OT) assets, the software responsible for controlling automated processes, your customer data, or trade secrets. At least in cybersecurity \u2014 with technology like asset visibility, identity and access management, and threat monitoring and response\u2013 you know where your security holes are, where there may be a gap in your defenses, or even whether you\u2019ve already had a breach. Here, we\u2019ve got much better odds of avoiding disaster because we do have technology: lots and lots of it, plus well-known best practices. Yet most of us using these practices, or worse, not using them, are also amateurs \u2014 non-security-trained employees. So there\u2019s huge room for error. In fact, Kaspersky\u2019s annual State of Industrial Cybersecurity Report found that half of all industrial control system (ICS) cybersecurity incidents last year were caused by human error. A demon-seed poster child for this finding might be last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s epic Twitter hacks: they started with phone spear-phishing, convincing employees to hand over credentials giving hackers access to internal systems. Zero Trust a Model for Cybersecurity and Covid-19 One often-mentioned model for thinking about cybersecurity best practices may be useful for thinking about coronavirus.\u00c2\u00a0 The Zero Trust Model \u2014 never trust, always verify \u2014 advises we should always assume the worst. Among other things, that means a user is not allowed access to the network until they\u2019ve been proven trustworthy. Given current best practices for Covid-19, zero trust would translate into no unmasked physical contact within at least 6 feet unless the person has been tested, preferably recently, or you are absolutely certain of where they\u2019ve been, who they\u2019ve contacted, and how well they disinfect themselves and relevant surfaces. As in cybersecurity best practices, it\u2019s not that difficult: but it does require being very, very thorough, every single time. There are still many unknowns in coronavirus America and industrial cybersecurity. New security vulnerabilities are being discovered every week: who knew the BootHole GRUB2 bootloader flaw existed before last month? Yet it affects billions of Windows and Linux devices. Just so, we\u2019re still uncertain about all the different symptom clusters, the different blood types, possible differences in T-cell configurations, and other vulnerabilities of human physiology that could either make us more likely to get Covid-19, or to have complications that can kill us. Meanwhile, attempts at contact tracing are complicated by unknowns such as whether or not the virus can be spread through the air. Dr. Fauci, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization keep telling us Covid-19 will get worse before it gets better. In like mind, on July 23 the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency issued a joint alert to owners and operators of critical infrastructure. It urged them to fix the cybersecurity holes in their ICS and other OT systems or suffer the effects of the growing risk of cyberattacks by foreign threat actors. We need to take immediate action on both fronts. Because all it takes is one.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
