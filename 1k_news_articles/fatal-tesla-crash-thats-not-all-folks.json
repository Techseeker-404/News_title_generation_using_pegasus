For an automotive industry now fixated on the development of self-driving cars \u00e2\u0080\u0094 among which the Tesla S is one of the grand experiments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the NTSB probe is a treasure trove of data. However, it falls short of determining who, or what, is to blame for the death of the driver. \u00c2\u00a0 The NTSB docket includes reports on highway design, vehicle performance, human performance, and motor carrier factors. The crash reconstruction report, included in the docket, describes the crash sequence, along with interview transcripts and summaries, photographs, and other investigative details. The NTSB emphasized that the docket contains \u00e2\u0080\u009conly factual information collected by NTSB investigators\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not provide analysis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It said no conclusions about how or why the crash occurred should be drawn from the docket. The NTSB is planning to release its own analysis, findings, recommendations, and a judgment about probable cause \u00e2\u0080\u009cat a later date.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Using system performance data downloaded from the passenger car, the report states that its speed just prior to impact with the trailer was 74 mph. The data also revealed that the driver was operating the car using automated vehicle control systems, a Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and the Autosteer lane-keeping system. Driver Assistance System  Among the documents released last week, the one entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDriver Assistance System\u00e2\u0080\u009d poses particular interest for EE Times readers. The report delves into details of how Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driver assistance system \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0consisting of a Bosch radar system, Mobileye image capture & processing system, an ultrasonic sensor system and gateway electronic control unit \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0works. It literally reads like a teardown of the Model S driver-assistance system. It also contains a few surprises, including how and where Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s captured data is stored, routed and saved inside a vehicle, and how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sent to Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s server using a virtual private network connection established via Wi-Fi, or using the vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3G cellular data capability.   The report says that Tesla S stores non-geo-located data in-vehicle in non-volatile memory using a removable SD card installed within the Gateway ECU. Really, an SD card? What role does the SD card play? No Event Data Recorder? After reading the report, Mike Demler, a senior analyst at The\u00c2\u00a0Linley\u00c2\u00a0Group, told EE Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI find the description of some of Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control and data-recording systems to be interesting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In particular, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe statement in the report that says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This SD card is large enough to typically maintain a complete record of all stored data for the lifetime of the vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is interesting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could they determine how much data will be generated over the lifetime of the vehicle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Unfortunately, the NTSB report doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer such questions. But one thing is clear. The NTSB apparently sees this \u00e2\u0080\u009cremovable\u00e2\u0080\u009d SD card as a proxy for an event data recorder (EDR). Because current NTSB specs do not require an EDR (it\u2019s completely voluntary), the NTSB appears to conclude that Tesla did enough. Danny Kim, director and partner of Vision Systems Intelligence\u00c2\u00a0(VSI), told EE Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Tesla Model S involved in this crash did not, nor was it required to by regulation, contain an event data recorder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even had it included an EDR, he noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe current EDR, outlined by the regulation, is outdated and it does not reflect what autonomous vehicles can do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kim said, however, that sooner or later there will probably be a new regulation including an EDR mandate, per NHTSA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendations last fall.
