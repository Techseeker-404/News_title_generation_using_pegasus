In conjunction with the acquisition, Cadence and NI, which have been working together for some time, have also entered a strategic alliance to work in tandem to serve mutual customers in the communications sector. AWR specializes in design tools for millimeter wave (mmWave) and microwave products, largely at the board and system level, while Cadence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heritage is in chip design and IP. AWR also has more experience with III-V semiconductors that out-perform silicon in high-frequency devices. The foundations of the combined Cadence and AWR product lines will be Cadence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Virtuoso layout suite of tools, for analog, digital and mixed-signal designs, and its Allegro tools for a variety of packaged circuits. One of the areas where AWR and Cadence have been working together is with a product that bridges packaged chip design with printed circuit board design; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called AWR Connect for Cadence Allegro.
