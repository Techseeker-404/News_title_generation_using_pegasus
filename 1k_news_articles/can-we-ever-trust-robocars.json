People of a certain age, like me, like to get behind a wheel of a car and take it for a spin. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown up with the concept of speed and power, and that has inculcated a joy of driving among many of us. But talk to people in Generation Z and the millennial generation and you get a totally different attitude: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutonomous vehicles are coming, so why do we need to drive?\u00e2\u0080\u009d is something that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll often hear from this new generation. But how long will they have to wait for it to become commonplace? Will we ever trust autonomous vehicles? And who will be first with a mass-market autonomous vehicle offer that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the luxury price range like the Tesla? Just a few days ago, Jaguar Land Rover started to consider the trust issue and announced that it fitted virtual eyes to intelligent pods to understand how humans will trust self-driving vehicles. As part of an engineering project, it is working with cognitive psychologists to better understand how vehicle behavior affects human confidence in new technology and how much information should be shared with other road users. The intelligent pods will run autonomously on a fabricated street scene in Coventry, U.K., while the behavior of pedestrians will be analyzed as they wait to cross the road. The \u00e2\u0080\u009ceyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the pods will seek out the pedestrian \u00e2\u0080\u0094 appearing to \u00e2\u0080\u009clook\u00e2\u0080\u009d directly at them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 signalling to road users that it has identified them and intends to take avoiding action. Engineers will record trust levels in the person before and after the pod makes \u00e2\u0080\u009ceye contact\u00e2\u0080\u009d to find out whether it generates sufficient confidence that it would stop for them. Previous studies suggest that as many as 63% of pedestrians and cyclists say they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d feel less safe sharing the road with a self-driving vehicle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second nature to glance at the driver of the approaching vehicle before stepping into the road,\u201d said Pete Bennett, future mobility research manager at Jaguar Land Rover. \u201cUnderstanding how this translates in tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more automated world is important. We want to know if it is beneficial to provide humans with information about a vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions or whether simply letting a pedestrian know it has been recognized is enough to improve confidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  So, we have a dichotomy. On the one hand, driverless cars are deemed an important step in reducing the number of deaths on roads due to human error. But on the other side of this, the public is a long way from trusting these vehicles on the road and maybe even unwilling to let a car do the driving for some people. A study published earlier this year attempted to answer the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are the key factors influencing trust in driverless cars?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It seemed to suggest that people are most likely to adopt driverless cars in closed environments, such as a university campus, and on highways, where drivers can then take full control. The driverless pods in operation at Heathrow airport in London since 2011 are an example of a closed environment and claim to have eliminated some 70,000 bus journeys a year. But there are other issues that may challenge driverless cars. One is erratic human behavior, which the artificial intelligence (AI) in the car may not be able to detect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as jaywalkers coming out of the blue when they are not supposed to be crossing a road. Maybe humans will have to adapt to accommodate driverless cars? Another issue is insurance. While the regulatory framework is still evolving, there could always be the issue of determining whether the driver or the manufacturer was negligent or who was responsible for an accident. In the U.K., a bill has been passed in Parliament putting into place the regulatory framework that will allow insurers to insure automated and electric vehicles when they start appearing on roads from 2021 onwards. The legislation will give insurers the right to recover costs when technology failure causes an accident, meaning that drivers are not unfairly held responsible for accidents they could do nothing to prevent. This could certainly be a big positive step. However, while this is welcome, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) says that the question still remains about how insurers will be given access to crucial post-crash data.
