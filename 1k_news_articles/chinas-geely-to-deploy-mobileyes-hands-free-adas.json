Mobileye (part of Intel), made the announcement Thursday. Mobileye said Geely will be using the technology, called SuperVision, in \u201chigh volume.\u201d Geely unveiled its premium electric vehicle, the Zero Concept from Lynk & Co.  SuperVision consists of two Mobileye EyeQ5 SoCs, and 11 cameras \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seven long-range and four close-range. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a camera-only turnkey solution without radars or lidars. Amnon Shashua, president and CEO of Mobileye, described SuperVision as \u00e2\u0080\u009cADAS done right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mobileye uses built-in algorithmic redundancy in the camera-only system, while striving to make advanced ADAS features affordable to consumers. Shashua explained that SuperVision is already a well-proven system. It supports the capabilities Mobileye demonstrated in drone-view videos (see below) of its L4 AV test driving in Jerusalem. In other words, Mobileye is importing software developed for L4 test AVs to consumer L2/L2+ vehicles.  During the conference call, Shashua called the design win with Geely \u00e2\u0080\u009cmomentous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Financially it\u2019s momentous because MobilEye can now sell something much more valuable than the current front-facing camera system. Further, SuperVision comes with an over-the-air (OTA) upgrade capability, offering a scalable feature that supports hands-free highway driving, navigation-based highway-to-highway, on/off ramp, and up to urban hands-free driving. Egil Juliussen, an automotive industry analyst, called Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SuperVision \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good move.\u00e2\u0080\u009d MobilEye has a huge installed base of car OEMs who already use Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s front-facing cameras. He said SuperVision gives Mobileye the ability to offer its existing customers an upgrade path. SuperVision allows Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers to catch up with rivals who have advanced L2+ systems, such as Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AutoPilot. In turn, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also good strategy \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor Mobileye to retain its lead in the ADAS market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. Click the image to enlarge. System Architecture of SuperVision. (Source: Mobileye) Imagers winning Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SuperVision signals an emerging trend in the ADAS market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe camera camp has been gaining as of late. And the technology continues to improve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed Phil Magney, founder & principal of VSI Labs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe imagers are getting better, the software is getting better, and the integration of software and processors is getting tighter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mike Demler, a senior analyst at The Linley Group, wondered about the absence of radar, though. Given that Shashua noted during the conference call that radar doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cost much, why wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Mobileye add radar to its SuperVision? Demler noted that if an OEM wanted to add a radar, there should be no problem, since \u00e2\u0080\u009cMobileye uses radar in their test vehicles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Tesla doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t officially support hands-off, Demler believes the capabilities supported by SuperVision \u00e2\u0080\u009clook pretty much equivalent, using 11 cameras instead of 8, and apparently no radar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Demler sees Amnon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that the Geely deal is a game changer as \u00e2\u0080\u009coverblown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The significance of this news is that the deal \u00e2\u0080\u009crepresents the first announced production vehicles to use EyeQ5.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added that this is in line with what Mobileye previously said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe 7nm EyeQ5 chip would enter volume production in late 2020.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Danny Kim, partner and director at VSI Labs, similarly believes it\u2019s significant that this is the first time Mobileye will be supplying OEMs with a 360-degree camera perception system, complete with vertically integrated end-to-end Mobileye stacks. Mobileye may seem to be defying the conventional practice among car OEMs for fusing forward-facing camera perception systems with other sensors such as radar. Separate subsystems coming SuperVision is a camera-only system designed for Level 2 and Level 2+ cars, but Mobileye is also creating separate subsystems with radar and lidar that could be used for L4 robo-taxis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOEMs that want to use this SuperVision system in L4 systems will need/want a radar/lidar redundant system\u00e2\u0080\u009d to be provided by Intel/Mobileye in the future, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor they can do it on their own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Intel/Mobileye spokesperson. And \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey could add radar to their L2/L2+ systems if desired, but the SuperVision system doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d SuperVision is capable of offering \u00c2\u00a0L2+ features without radar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause of RSS (Responsibility-Sensitive Safety) and the HD map.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Who else would go for SuperVision? So, who will get the most out of SuperVision, other than China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Geely? Juliussen believes the answer is Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing customers. VSI Labs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Kim, on the other hand, cites potential benefits to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmany EV startups who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully invest in ADAS development and would be better off with Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turnkey solution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kim also believes many traditional OEMs won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t embrace vision-only SuperVision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust like Volkswagen who would provide 8 million vehicles over time with forward-facing camera perception system powered by Mobileye EyeQ5, many carmakers would just fuse 360-degree radars or other sensors with forward-facing cameras,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  Recommended The Button Revolution Is Here | On Succession | The Internet of IoT   Magney predicted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think in time you will see some of the big OEMs ditch their proprietary developments and just buy the Intel/Mobileye solution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Magney added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe legacy auto industry is on thin ice already and cannot afford to waste money developing their own AV stacks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Magney made it clear that \u00e2\u0080\u009cL2+ is hard to do without 360-degree vision. You either have to build your own or buy into the Nvidia/ARM camp or the Intel/Mobileye camp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Demler took a more jaded view. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe beneficiaries are Mobileye for the increased revenue, and the Chinese consumers that are able to afford the Zero Concept luxury vehicles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his view, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really change the landscape for L2/L3 ADAS. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still Mobileye, Nvidia, and Tesla, followed by a few startups and some custom ASICs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Geely \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Volvo Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SuperVision will be designed into Geely\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premium EV, called Zero Concept, from Lynk & Co, a brand within the Geely Auto Group. Lynk & Co is a Chinese-Swedish automobile company. Founded in 2016, its cars are positioned between those of the Geely brand and Swedish brand Volvo. The Swedish automaker was purchased by Geely in 2010. Juliussen noted that Geely in China is not a state-supported automaker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an independent company in China, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good get for Mobileye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. According to Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press release, Geely has \u00e2\u0080\u009cdelivered, to date, over 300,000 Lynk & Co units to customers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The new Geely-Mobileye connection presents potentially an interesting question, as Nvidia announced in 2018 an agreement with Volvo. According to the announcement at that time, Volvo will use Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Xavier computer for its next-generation vehicles, with production starting early 2020\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Multidomain controller? In the announcement, Mobileye noted: Mobileye will be responsible for the full solution stack, including hardware and software, driving policy and control. Due to the complexity of the project, we will also supply a multidomain controller that will be validated for automotive and serve as a subsystem for very advanced ADAS solutions worldwide. So, what exactly is a multidomain controller? The block diagram on Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product sheet shows an MCU. But we do not know whose MCU that is. Asked for clarification, Intel/Mobileye described it as an ASIL-D MCU on the PCB that provides domain controller functionality and connects to vehicle communication buses. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a common architecture. But the difference here is that the PCB uses Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software, not that of Tier One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or OEM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. So, the short answer is that this PCB (which functions as a multidomain controller) is Intel/Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home-grown solution embedded with a small MCU that is most likely sourced from elsewhere. Shashua added that the PCB, based on Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reference design, will be produced by a contract manufacturer, Quanta. How far does OTA go? Industry analysts liked hearing that Mobileye is enabling OTA on the SuperVision solution. However, Juliussen questioned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not sure whether this OTA reaches out to other ECUs in a vehicle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There are a host of ECUs deployed inside an EV. Each ECU controls different functions in the car, and presumably, in theory, each could updated via OTA. But it is not known how many of those ECUs could be controlled by the SuperVision\u2019s OTA.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
