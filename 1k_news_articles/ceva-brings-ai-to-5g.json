But now that the first phase of 5G standardization is complete, with the publication of 3GPP-Release 15, the biggest deal in the mobile industry is how best and how fast it can bring to customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 equipment 5G New Radio, very-wide-bandwidth radio channels supporting data-access speeds of up to 10 Gbit per second. In short, so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cenhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB)\u00e2\u0080\u009d is everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main chance right now, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where a fierce 5G race will unfold in sunny Catalonia. Among tech suppliers, Ceva Inc. will be in Barcelona, riding high with its comprehensive 5G New Radio enhanced Mobile Broadband IP Platform. Ceva devised its platform for designers of 5G smartphones, fixed wireless access and embedded devices.  Gideon Wertheizer  Gideon Wertheizer, Ceva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, told EE Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany companies\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether they plan to use 5G for the fixed wireless or embedded systems\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 are looking for technology they can bootstrap themselves to reach the entry point of the 5G market\u00e2\u0080\u009d as soon as possible. Calling 5G \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely complicated technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wertheizer said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are telling us they need something now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With a 5G IP platform called PentaG, Ceva is offering \u00e2\u0080\u009ca 5G modem subsystem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emmanuel Gresset, business development director of the wireless business unit at CEVA, told us. The PentaG, based on a flexible architecture, has several key IP components. These include Ceva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enhanced XC4500 DSP with 5G ISA extensions, a PentaG AI processor and vector MAC unit co-processor, a cluster of Ceva-X2 DSPs and a polar and LDPC encoder and decoder accelerator. They also come with necessary software to go with them.  (Source: Ceva) Ceva brags about the flexibility of the PnetaG platform. It allows potential customers to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmix and match\u00e2\u0080\u009d any of PentaG IPs with their own design, explained Ceva CEO. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe PentaG architecture does not include a CPU,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. This is deliberate, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso that customers who want to use their own, legacy modem solutions can continue to do so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while they can bring in IP blocks from PentaG to enhance their 5G offerings. Neural networks meet 5G Perhaps most notable in the PentaG platform is its built-in AI processor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are the first to use neural networks for communication,\u00e2\u0080\u009d claimed Ceva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gresset. Wertheizer explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe found machine learning works really well when we have to figure out channel behavior in communication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeural networks work best when you need something you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t predict by programming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ceva has already trained the communication-related dataset on its own, offering customers patent-pending algorithms that go with the AI processor.   To maximize data throughput in 5G, a smartphone must send accurate channel-state information (CSI) to base stations. The CSI gives instructions to base stations so that in sending data, the stations can adapt transmissions to current channel conditions and certain parameters specified by smartphones. Constant closed-loop contact between smartphone and base station enables reliable communication with high-data rates in multiantenna systems, explained Gresset. Asked about the AI processor inside Ceva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5G IP platform, Mike Demler, senior analyst at the Linley Group, told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs far as I know the use of a neural-network engine in PentaG is unique. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very clever way to address the complexity and variability of 5G communication channels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeural network algorithms are good at identifying patterns in whatever data they are analyzing, and in PentaG-based modems designers can train the network to produce an optimum set of operating parameters that adapt to dynamically varying conditions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked why the neural network engine for 5G, Demler explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all a matter of optimization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBack in the analog radio days you would tune the knob to pull in a weak signal. Back in the day, I spent a lot of time \u00e2\u0080\u0098DXing\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on my old Transoceanic shortwave radio. Because of the 5G complexity, it would be more difficult to have a processor perform that optimization in real time, especially given the low-latency requirements. So, pretraining a neural-network inference engine to automatically adapt to varying link conditions is a better solution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wertheizer declined to provide details of the AI processor architecture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at this point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00c2\u00a0Ceva already announced last month at the Consumer Electronics Show what it calls NeuPro, a dedicated low-power AI processor family designed to do deep learning at the edge. The Ceva CEO called NeuPro \u00e2\u0080\u009ca general-purpose AI processor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while describing the new processor inside the PentaG as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca special-purpose communication machine learning processor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ceva was able to develop a special-purpose communication AI processor based on its experience\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than four years\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 building a tool chain for neural networks. Ceva used this with NeuPro, and it became handy for designing a communication-specific neural network processor. Wertheizer stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough we happened to find the use case [of this AI processor] in CSI, this engine can be extended to other applications as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  PentaG block diagram (Source: Ceva) Why is 5G New Radio so hard? Challenges in 5G NR are many. First, it requires high performance and optimized power. 5G NR enables a multi-gigabit capacity of 8 to10 Gps, compared to the LTE data rate of 100Mbps. What makes this tough, said Gresset, is that the 5G NR baseband processor, which is now receiving so much data, must process faster. 5G\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultra-low latency requirements shorten the time for data processing by five times, compared to LTE. Second, 5G also demands multi-mode architecture. A 5G-NR modem requires a unified platform for sub-6GHz and mmWave Multi-Radio Access Technology, while also supporting LTE-A Evolution. Third, flexibility is key to 5G NR optimization. 5G leverages massive MIMO algorithms, advanced beamforming techniques and complex link-adaptation schemes to sustain high-throughput. But the crux of the issue, as far as Demler sees it, is that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe 3GPP standards are still under development, so a modem design needs to be flexible to support evolving specifications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The phase two of the 5G standard is expected to come together at the end of this year. He noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTechnically, the designs are challenging because of the increased frequency-band diversity/modes compared to 4G, greater degree of carrier aggregation, increased channel bandwidth, etc., which all require higher performance and more sophisticated processing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   Competitive landscape Thus far, Qualcomm and Intel are the only two companies who have shown prototypes of their 5G modems. Demler said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only seen prototypes, such as their demo at the Olympics. Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s X50 is targeting 2019 production. Intel also announced its 5G-only XMM 8060 is scheduled for production in 2019, but it needs a separate chip to support 4G.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although Ceva might have picked up a few customers already using PentaG IP, Demler cautioned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to see any chips until sometime next year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Put simply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have yet to see any details on the Intel and Qualcomm designs, and Ceva is the only IP vendor I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m aware of offering a comprehensive hardware/software solution for 5G terminals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Demler. He believes PentaG will appeal to Ceva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing customers, since it employs some of the same building blocks as their 4G solutions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the end, any chips integrating PentaG need to compete against Qualcomm and Intel, but this is critical IP enabling other companies to move up to 5G,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Ceva, however, is hoping that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PentaG IP platform can disrupt traditional IP licensee dynamics. In addition to the usual suspects picking up the entire 5G-NR platform to design their own 5G baseband processors, incumbent LTE players such as Qualcomm, MediaTek or Intel who do not use Ceva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IPs for their modem offerings could, in theory, license the PnetaG platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI processor, for example.  (Source: Ceva) Demler agreed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be interesting to see if Ceva holds some key patents that enable them to license their link-adaptation technology separate from the other baseband components, perhaps even to a modem manufacturer like Qualcomm or Intel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked about PentaG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential customers,\u00c2\u00a0Wertheizer included everyone planning to go 5G. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are offering a new way of looking at modem architecture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition to incumbents like Qualcommm, MediaTek and Spreadtrum, Wertheizer said that semiconductor guys who want to newly enter 5G, and many more OEMs such as Samsung and Huawei are all fair game. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times        Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
