There are many outstanding technology players on the island helping the world evolve continuously and developing countless electronic products that bring convenience to humanity. Now, Taiwan is fully demonstrating its advantages of \u201csmall and beautiful\u201d, providing growth nutrients for many new startups with innovative ideas and already having some small achievements \u2014 at the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that will be held in Las Vegas on January 8th, where 44 of new startups from Taiwan will showcase their innovation capabilities to visitors from all over the world. In fact, in the new startups exhibition area of \u201cEureka Park\u201d at CES 2018, a total of 32 Taiwanese new startups led by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) made their debut. In addition to two teams winning the annual CES Innovation Award, some teams even won the favor of international investors with their outstanding performance. Soon to be taking part in CES 2019, the scale of new startups from Taiwan will not only be larger but also more adequately prepared so that CES visitors from all over the world will be deeply impressed by these potential stars of tomorrow. Led by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) was officially open to the general public in Taiwan during the summer of 2018 and will participate in the upcoming CES 2019 with the new startups from Taiwan as well as accompany them every step of the way.  First founded in the new startups base of Taipei during the summer of 2018, Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) has introduced accelerator resources and startup funds from all over the world by playing the key role as a public spokesperson for new startups from Taiwan. Dr. Lewis Chen, the Manager Director of TTA operations, said that the number of new startups from Taiwan gaining access to CES 2019 will not only grow in number but also in technology maturity and talent quality. Such outstanding achievement was supported by the fact that 8 new startups from Taiwan have received the annual CES Innovation Award this year; Managing Director Dr. Lewis Chen also pointed out that \u201cthese new startups have a clearer plan for their role positioning, and are more proficient in communicating with end users and international markets. I believe that the CES visitors this time will be deeply impressed and inspired by these new startups!\u201d The task of the TTA is to introduce international resources and establish a sound ecological environment so that new startups from Taiwan are nourished with sufficient nutrients for better growth. TTA will also be a public media platform that raises global awareness of the real power of these new startups from Taiwan and the value that they are able to bring to the global startup circle. So, what strength does Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s startups have? From the following eight teams that have already won the 2019 CES Innovation Award, you may be even more convinced to pay a visit to the 2019 CES exhibitions to learn more about these potential stars of tomorrow. Smart Security Battery Hits the North American E-bike Market As the market demand for e-bikes started to take off last year, Han-Win Technology, which started out with the Battery Management System (BMS), is actively expanding its core business to the light two-wheeled electric vehicles (including electric scooters and e-bikes). It is expected that Han-Win Technology will increase its visibility in the North American market by participating in CES, while contributing to global energy conservation and carbon reduction with its safe and efficient total solution. Founded in 2015, Han-Win Technology is composed of a team of key technologies from the upstream IC design industry and the downstream battery packs of the BMS industry. After successfully building its BMS technology, Han-Win Technology has been actively engaged in the medium to large scale energy storage system and even electric vehicles (EV) market, providing high-qualicty battery module solutions based on its core BMS technology for various applications and system integration, such as light e-bikes, EV, electric gardening tools and electric power tools. At CES 2019, Han-Win Technology's patented INNO-SAFETY technologies for e-Bike battery packs won the CES Innovation Award in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Smart Energy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 category. Danny Lu, vice president of the marketing department of Han-Win Technology, pointed out that the \u201cSuper Smart Safety INNO-SAFETY Battery Pack\u201d series introduces innovative patented technologies including \u00e2\u0080\u009cmulti-stage soft start\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexternal loop short-circuit pre-detection\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely low static power consumption\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which dramatically inhibit inrush current while the power of the battery pack is turned on, while prevent shortening of the battery life due to excessive idle time. Using the platform concept to design its BMS system, Han-Win Technology can quickly adjust to different serial strings of the battery according to customer needs, and widely support 4 to 20 strings of lithium battery applications. In addition to being selected for the CES Innovation Award, Lu said that his company has been working with several e-bike motor manufacturers, in an effort to providing customers with a safe, reliable and long-lasting lithium battery management solution.
