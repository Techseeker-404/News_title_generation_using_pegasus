The announcement connects previously-revealed separate partnerships and collaborations, solidifying the three-way alliance. Danny Shapiro, Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior director of automotive, told EE Times in a phone interview, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a transactional deal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 such as Nvidia supplies chips to Bosch, and Bosch provides modules to Daimler. This is a strategic partnership, in which each company has a distinct role to play.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Specifically, the two German companies\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Bosch and Daimler\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 will join to deploy Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Drive Pegasus platform for \u00e2\u0080\u009cmachine-learning methods in generating vehicle-driving algorithms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Bosch. Nvidia will provide its Drive Pegasus based platform, including \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh-performance AI automotive processors along with system software,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bosch added. The alliance is focused on bringing highly automated vehicles to urban streets, seeking to populate cities with robotaxis. Phil Magney, founder and principal at VSI Labs, told EE Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have known about the Bosch, Daimler, and Nvidia stuff for a while now.\u00c2\u00a0 Now it is official that the architecture will be Nvidia Pegasus and Bosch will be the tier one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He noted that a handful of robo-taxi companies have announced plans to use the Pegasus. However, this Bosch-Daimler-Nvidia\u00c2\u00a0announcement is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first OEM/Tier-one partnership with hardened plans to design their robo-taxi around the Drive Pegasus architecture,\u201d he explained.

As reported previously, Xilinx and Daimler are working on AI-based solution, but the two companies failed to provide any details on this. Magney suspects that they are two separate programs for Daimler. He explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike many OEMs, when it comes to automated driving there are at least two different programs going on. One being automated driving (L2/L3) for series production, and the other for robo-taxis (L4+). It is possible that Nvidia is being used for the robo-taxi program while Xilinx is being used for the ADAS or incremental (L2+) programs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Further, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlso, Xilinx and Nvidia are not necessarily mutually exclusive. An automated driving stack\u00c2\u00a0has multiple threads going on at once for different tasks within the AV stack. Some things are better suited for the GPU architecture while other might be better suited for FPGAs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Networked ECUs  Bosch, a leading supplier of sensors and automotive parts, started using the prototype of Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Xavier to develop AI-based AV modules last year. The deal between Bosch and Nvidia was announced in March 2017. Based on its own experience in developing sensor processing units for AVs, Bosch estimated the ECU network for automated urban driving must be able to handle \u00e2\u0080\u009chundreds of trillions of operations per second.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In fusing the sensory data collected and transmitted by radar, video, lidar and ultrasonic sensors, the ECU network is expected to do everything from assessing information (including object detection and map localization) to planning the trajectory of a vehicle \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithin just 20 milliseconds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Bosch.\u00c2\u00a0 Of course, the amount of sensor data such an ECU must deal with is enormous. One video sensor alone, such as Bosch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stereo video camera, generates 100 gigabytes of data in just one kilometer, according to Bosch. The pressure on the ECU network to quickly process such combined data is also intense because safety depends on that processing speed.\u00c2\u00a0 This is part of the reason why Bosch and Daimler chose Nvidia. They believe the Drive Pegasus platform can keep pace their specified computing power. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inside Pegasus platform?  Assuming that massive computing performance is necessary to run multiple complex algorithms in parallel and execute them within milliseconds, what kind of hardware is necessary? Meet Drive Pegasus. Nvidia boasts that Pegasus, consisting of two Xavier SoCs and two yet-to-be announced \u00e2\u0080\u009cnext-generation\u00e2\u0080\u009d GPUs, delivers 320 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) to \u00e2\u0080\u009chandle diverse and redundant algorithms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More important, Shapiro stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPegasus offers the most energy efficient solution at one TOPS per watt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked about the new GPU inside Pegasus, Shapiro declined to provide details, noting that the company has not disclosed it yet.
