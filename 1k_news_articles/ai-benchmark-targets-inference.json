The effort spun out of a separate benchmark that the group plans to release in June for chips used in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The work marks at least the third major initiative in six months to measure performance of neural-network jobs. It may be the first to focus on chips for power-constrained embedded systems. Last month, Baidu and Facebook announced work with a handful of chipmakers on ML Perf, initially focused on training jobs in data centers. The Transaction Processing Council formed an effort in December that also likely will focus on training. EEMBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI work group is centered around chips for smart speakers, nodes, and gateways for the Internet of Things and other embedded systems. It has met three times to date and aims to release a benchmark before June next year. The separate ADAS benchmark is already in beta test with multiple users. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs we were building the ADAS benchmark, we found way more interest in the neural network at the end of it from engineers being pushed to learn this very complex space,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Peter Torelli, who recently became president of EEMBC. So far, the work group has about a dozen members from embedded processor vendors such as Arm, Analog Devices, Intel, Nvidia, NXP, Samsung, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments. It aims to embrace a variety of neural-net types and use cases. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for more input, especially from integrators and OEMs making component choices, to make sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something they can use,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Torelli. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also need to get a handle on what network architectures are important and which ones will be portable to the edge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The benchmark aims to measure raw inference performance as well as the time to spin up a neural-net model. The group also hopes that it can define a way to measure power efficiency of the tasks in a standard way. The initiative aims to use behavioral models, allowing users to adopt whatever frameworks or runtimes they choose in hopes of maximizing optimization. Members are debating whether the test will include levels representing tasks of low, moderate, and high complexity. The effort is chaired by Ramesh Jaladi, an Intel director of engineering in computer vision and machine learning who has worked on benchmarks for a variety of systems. Arm executives praised EEMBC for its good work in a wide variety of past benchmarks for embedded processors, but said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still early days for the AI effort. The company also is working with China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI Industry Alliance on a separate effort for an inference benchmark that is further along. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are keen to help sponsor a set of useful [AI] benchmarks in the industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dennis Laudick, a vice president of marketing in Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s machine learning group. EEMBC's separate ADAS benchmark is built on OpenCL and tests eight computing elements in three broad phases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 2D image detection, contour detection, and inferencing using convolutional neural networks. One carmaker is involved in the project that started two years ago. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times    "}
