Those of us not able to attend in person could watch it all through IEEEtv. The two days of presentations and panels highlighted 5G's many aspects that included the technology \u00e2\u0080\u0094 5G New Radio (5GNR) to millimeter-wave (mmWave) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the business use cases needed to make 5G a success.    While 5GNR and mmWave technologies will bring higher data rates, the concepts of network slicing and edge computing within 5G could open new business use cases. Indeed, both computing resources have gained so much interest this year that the Brooklyn Summit dedicated an entire panel to them. Network slicing and edge computing appeared across several panels and presentations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe core network is getting more important,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said DOCOMO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kenichirou Matsumoto. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe network cloud needs to divide to become more local,\u00e2\u0080\u009d referring to moving computation away from network cores. AT&T\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Peter Musgrave added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe core needs more attention than 5GNR.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    The idea behind network slicing stems from the fact that different users need different wireless services. A factory has different needs than a consumer or an IoT device. Instead of simply trying to build a network that moves bits faster, as was the case for 3G and 4G, network slicing lets applications take advantage of a virtual network that brings the most value.    Fig. 1 shows the three most thought-about slices: mobile broadband, autonomous driving, and IoT. But there could be thousands of network slices developed over time. Some might even be dynamic, being created and destroyed as needed. Verizon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bill Stone opened his presentation by noting that the first slice for 5G will be fixed internet access.      Fig. 1: Network slicing works on the concept of having software-defined virtual networks that are optimized for specific characteristics. Click image to enlarge.      Network slices could combine with cloud computing at the network edge to move some calculations away from local sources as well as away from the cloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core. Latency and reliability are at stake here. Such movement away from smart machines would push control functions and calculations from hardware to software, and moving functions from the core to the edge reduces response time. As Fig. 2 shows, computing might become partly at the core and partly at the edge.      Fig. 2: Some applications could use a combination of edge and core computations.       Bosch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andreas M\u00c3\u00bceller explained in a presentation how network slicing might be used in future factories. For example, a slice with especially low latency and high reliability might handle critical functions such as emergency stop buttons. He also spoke of using a network slice combined with edge computing to control robots in a factory, collect manufacturing data, and keep the robots moving while, for safety, stopping when a person walked by. Bosch is experimenting with controlling factory robots over an LTE network now in anticipation of using the lower latency and higher reliability expected from 5G.    As Fig. 1 shows, another network slice might also handle low-data-rate functions inherent in many IoT devices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftware-driven procedures will be more modular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Musgrave. \u00e2\u0080\u009c5G computing architecture will look more like an API.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, we might see network slices evolve to where businesses connect their applications to a network slice through an API. Factories might even have their own dedicated slices running over a cellular or local network. But that local network would not use Wi-Fi because of potential interference. Businesses could, in effect, rent their own network slices or share a slice with others who have similar needs. M\u00c3\u00bceller spoke of the ability to create a new network slice within minutes, then tear it down when no longer needed. He cited several reasons why network slicing is needed for factory automation:    Highly demanding QoS requirements. Many different use cases with very diverse requirements. Well-isolated integration of third parties in own infrastructure. Shift of intelligence to the network. Remote access/control with well-defined QoS and security. Application-specific network functions such as mobility and management.    The API concept raised a few eyebrows in Brooklyn. While some talked of computing within 5G as promoting an open, shared ecosystem, it does raise the question of who will host the edge-computing functions. Should network operators get into the cloud computing business?     Does network software need more attention than 5GNR and mmWave links? Not yet. First, the industry needs the basic 5G infrastructure that starts with 5GNR. That will likely trigger the application that is always at the forefront of faster data rates: gaming. Video will soon follow as people see the advantages of downloading a move right before getting onto a long flight. Some, however, argue that factories and IIoT will drive the need for computing changes even before consumer uses.    \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
