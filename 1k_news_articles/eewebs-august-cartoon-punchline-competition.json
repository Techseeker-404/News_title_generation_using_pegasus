One of the most popular diversions on EETimes, for example, is the monthly Cartoon Caption Competition. At the time of this writing, this month\u2019s competition A Breath of Fresh Air has already attracted 91 entries. But there\u2019s no need for the fun to stop here. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget that we also have a monthly Cartoon Punchline Competition on our sister site EEWeb.com. This month\u2019s competition compares engineers to saints, which seems perfectly reasonable to me.  How do you think Bob should respond to Betsy? Why not bounce over to the competition and offer your suggestion? As always, the winner of this month\u2019s contest will receive a full-size copy of the original cartoon, adorned with his or her caption and signed by the artist. Related posts:  Want More Pi?
