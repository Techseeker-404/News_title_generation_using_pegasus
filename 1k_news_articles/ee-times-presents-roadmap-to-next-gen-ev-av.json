Electrification and automation are megatrends changing the face of the auto industry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe All-Electric future\u00e2\u0080\u009d envisioned by General Motors CEO Mary Barra, for example, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a slogan. Barra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans to exclusively offer electric vehicles by 2035 is now a formal business strategy. GM has set its sights on ending production of cars, trucks, and SUVs with diesel- and gasoline-powered engines. The rise of EVs isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happening in isolation. It poses the opportunity for carmakers to rethink their current vehicle architecture and imagine a whole new portfolio of vehicle design. The goal is not only to accommodate EV batteries but also to embed a host of automated innovations inside next-generation cars. The extension of EV driving range, pursued by every carmaker, rests on the increased efficiency of power conversion. The adoption of wide bandgap semiconductors is one key to this goal. In parallel, automakers must be mindful of growing compute power. It is a necessary evil that accompanies ADAS and AV features, but it also directly affects EV mileage. This reality makes newly designed, in-vehicle power management systems increasingly important. For now, the launch of fully autonomous vehicles that can drive safely at any time anywhere under any weather remains a moving target. Meanwhile, ADAS features embedded in vehicles continue to proliferate, aided by more sensors and processing power. Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who in the industry In preparation for this three-day conference, editors at EE Times, myself and my colleague Maurizio Di Paolo Emilio, are asking keynote speakers not to sidestep hard questions that need answers. For instance, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference in safety requirements between cars with human drivers and vehicles that use automation to steer, brake and dodge pedestrians? How will those different responsibilities affect automakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sensor-fusion strategies? This is a topic Phil Koopman, CTO of Edge Case Research and assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, is prepared to discuss. Phil Magney, founder of VSI Labs, explains how best to combine sensors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 each of which might not be perfect on its own \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to get better results. Egil Juliussen, veteran auto industry analyst and an EE Times columnist (\u00e2\u0080\u009cEgil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eye\u00e2\u0080\u009d), will dive into coming disruptions in auto electronics system architecture. Colin Barnden, lead analyst at Semicast Research and an EE Times columnist (\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeriously Skeptical\u00e2\u0080\u009d), will present why we need driving monitoring systems (DMS), aiming his analysis at those who are still skeptical of DMS. On the EV side of the discussion, Ana Villamor, a Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement analyst, will open the virtual event by sharing insights on the wide bandgap semiconductor race in EVs. Alex Q. Huang, professor, University of Texas, Austin, will make the case for high power, and high-power density EV inverters based on GaN power devices. Huang will be followed by Anup Bhalla, vice president of engineering, UnitedSiC, discussing how the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s search for the perfect switch is driving SiC in EVs. Ivo Marocco, director at Texas Instruments, will hone in on next-generation battery management. The virtual event also features four separate all-star industry panels. These forums will include executives from Infineon, Nexperia, STMicroelectronics, Arm, NXP Semiconductors, Nvidia, Siemens/Mentor, ADI, Xilinx, Omnivision, Veoneer and Seeing Machines.  Registration to the virtual event is open now.
