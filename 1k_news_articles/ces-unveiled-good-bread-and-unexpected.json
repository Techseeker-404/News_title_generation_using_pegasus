Whether consumer devices are connected to social media or Netflix, Internet connectivity has played a critical role in developing features, applications and services. In fact, connectivity\u00c2\u00a0 gave birth to a new normal in the consumer electronics industry. Today,\u00c2\u00a0apps and services determine the success of consumer products. The CE industry, however, will be moving from the connectivity age into \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe data age\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the next decade, predicted Steve Koening, vice president of market research at\u00c2\u00a0the Consumer Technology Association (CTA). Discussing\u00c2\u00a0CES 2019 Trends to Watch, Koening suggested that\u00c2\u00a0it will be data and its analytics that define the quality of consumer products.\u00c2\u00a0More and more, users make decisions backed up by data. Data is\u00c2\u00a0emerging as the\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009ccommon denominator\u00e2\u0080\u009d among \u00c2\u00a0products, he said. Most evident at CES this year is an unmistakable trend toward voice and AI-based digital assistants. Analysts at CTA believe that \u00e2\u0080\u009csupporting digital assistants has become table stakes\u00e2\u0080\u009d for OEMs. As devices become data-centric, the \u201cCES Unveiled\u201d event\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually a chaotic display of disparate consumer devices designed by startups\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 included some technology suppliers openly posing privacy issues (\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you really want Big Tech to know everything about you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Others were adamant\u00c2\u00a0in stressing that security must be integral to every IoT device (\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to retrofit technology\u00e2\u0080\u009d). EE Times shares\u00c2\u00a0a sampling of the good, the bad and the unexpected at \u201cCES Unveiled\u201d in following pages.    Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s startup to shoot for moon  (Source: ispace)Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s startup ispace dreams big. It plans to go to the moon. The ispace team, with roots in the Google Lunar X Prize competition, has selected SpaceX for a pair of missions in 2020 and 2021 to orbit and then land on the moon. Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ispace will fly these missions as secondary payloads on SpaceX Falcon 9 launches. The goal of the first privately-led Japanese test mission is to relay lunar data to the Earth, as a first stage for Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0093Moon transport service technology. The second mission will put Japan\u2019s first lander on the moon, deploying a rover on the lunar surface. This\u00c2\u00a0will be\u00c2\u00a0a test mission to transport payloads to the Moon and send lunar surface data back to Earth. For decades, governments have taken on the task and risks of space development. Startups, such as ispace, are \u00e2\u0080\u009cpotentially better positioned to achieve results with more speed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d argued Shuhei Akimoto, an\u00c2\u00a0ispace representative. He said ispace is developing small, lightweight landers and rovers to establish a low-cost platform for scheduled transportation by applying \u00e2\u0080\u009cJapan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precision manufacturing processes and repurposing commercial-off-the-shelf products to reduce weight and scale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked\u00c2\u00a0about the ispace\u00c2\u00a0business model, he said the startup plans to make money by doing the following:  \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 High frequency lunar transport ( ispace will carry \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour payloads\u00e2\u0080\u009d aboard the landers and rovers enabled by micro-robotics). \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Sale and survey of moon surface data (it will collect wide-ranging data including imaging, temperature, radiation, sun angle). \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Sponsorship (allowing sponsors to put their names on rovers, for example).   The lander: Onboard is a fixed payload that does not require movement. These include cameras, communications devices, cell cultivation devices.  The rover: Onboard on the rover are payloads that require movement on the moon. These include video and driving data acquisition as well as resource harvesting systems.    BlackBerry\u2019s security technologies are integrated into this ultra-secure mobile phone by Punkt. BlackBerry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security prowess is well known. The company is now bringing that \u00e2\u0080\u009csecure technology\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 once available in its BB10, then on its Android phones \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0to IoT devices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery IoT device needs security,\u00e2\u0080\u009d BlackBerry CTO Charles Eagan told us. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to retrofit security.\u00e2\u0080\u009d BlackBerry used CES Unveiled to launch BlackBerry Secure technology and its licensing strategy. The company is now offering a suite of security technologies to OEMs who design and manufacture IoT devices. They include, according to Egan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecure manufacturing (injecting secure identity key into the hardware during production), secure boot, secure platform boot (locking down software being executed with secure boot and Arm Trustzone), secure operation framework, paired security keys, continued re-authentication token and integrity detection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The company provides security throughout the product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life cycle. It also offers integrity detection service to components (kernel, Pathtrust, SELinux, etc.) across the software stack. Has anybody licensed any of these technologies? Eagan said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is our coming out party. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just announced our licensing strategy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  BackBerry\u2019s CTO Charles Eagen at CES Unveiled    (Source: Mycroft.ai) Voice AI shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be limited to smart speakers. If you are designing a new product today, you are likely to consider\u00c2\u00a0adding a voice assistant. Voice is the most intuitive man-machine interface. But how\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0do that without committing yourself to be a part of big ecosystems\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 strongholds of Amazon, Google or Apple? Mycroft offers system designers \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first open-source voice assistant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0a range of voice AI including software stack, wake-word spotting, speech-to-text, natural language understanding and speech synthesis. As voice AI becomes ubiquitous, Mycroft CEO Joshua Montgomery says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI encourage you to think carefully about the data they are generating and how it is used.\u00c2\u00a0 Do you really want Big Tech to know everything about you? Are you comfortable letting them listen in your kitchen? Your office? Your bedroom?Do they have your best interest at heart?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Instead of capturing data from all of its users indiscriminately,\u00c2\u00a0Mycroft says it only uses data from users who have explicitly opted in. Mycroft is also building tools that use voluntary contributions instead of collected data. Is this privacy pitch Mycroft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way of fending off growing backlash against Big Tech like Facebook and Google? No, said Montgomery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe founded Mycroft in 2015 with a very strong focus on privacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Further, he added, it is even possible to design a voice assistant-enabled device, which does its own AI inference locally (done by Xilinx\u2019 FPGA) and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to send data to big clouds owned by Amazon, for example. \u00e2\u0080\u009cData never has to leave home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d    Cambridge Consultants demonstrated a web cam installed in a dummy head that sees distorted images via block glass. Using AI, it restores images before\u00c2\u00a0distortion in real time. It\u2019s a cool demo, but this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a product that Cambridge Consultants is actually selling. \u201cWe are demonstrating what we are capable of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Thomas Carmody, head of transport and infrastructure, wireless and digital services at Cambridge Consultants. Founded in 1960, the company\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0800 employees are\u00c2\u00a0engaged in 400 projects\u00c2\u00a0a year, said Carmody.  Similar AI technologies shown in the demo are currently being applied to develop radars, optics, ultrasounds and others, he noted. The idea is to test and examine how those sensor technologies can handle distorted images in treacherous weather conditions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCurrently, we have clients in Japan and Korea working with us to develop things like autonomous vehicles and robots for agriculture applications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Carmody.    Latency is kept minimum. As\u00c2\u00a08K turns into a hot item at CES, 4K almost feels like an old news. In truth, nobody\u2019s doing \u00e2\u0080\u009creal-time\u00e2\u0080\u009d streaming of 4K video. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are surveillance cameras handling 4K but they pay no attention to latency,\u201d said\u00c2\u00a0Derick Hui, executive director and founder of Hong Kong-based ViShare Technology Ltd. To use 4K video for streaming video games or a wireless projector, you need a compression technology that achieves almost real-time capability with \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisually lossless\u00e2\u0080\u009d video images, he explained. ViShare Technology has designed an\u00c2\u00a0encoding and decoding scheme similar to H.264. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we optimized it and applied our own low-latency technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Hui. In the demonstration, ViShare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s codec compresses 12Gbit 4K video down to 100Mbit video. The latency involved in the compression is 8 milliseconds, said Hui.  Its demonstration board uses FPGA for both encode and decode. The company is targeting a 55nm\u00c2\u00a0chip by March. Hui said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big. I wish we could use 28nm or 14nm. But that would be too expensive for us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The chip will go into a dongle to enable wireless 4K streaming.    Women are bombarded\u00c2\u00a0by marketing pitches for new skincare or makeup products. They promise to make fine wrinkles disappear in two weeks, remove dark spots in a month, or improve skin complexion in 60 days. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to resist the temptation to try such products. But most women are troubled by the uncertainty\u00c2\u00a0of whether any of this stuff is actually working. A 13-inch mirror with 10.1\u00e2\u0080\u009d TFT LCD touch panel comes with an 8-megapixel CMOS camera with an\u00c2\u00a0Arm-based eight-core CPU. HiMirror analyzes\u00c2\u00a0skin condition through a photo. Photos are stored with measurement data, allowing HiMirror to track progress over time. It also offers tips\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as target areas that need the most attention.    Agan Aroma has expanded its Moodo line of aromatherapy products\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 offering 30 different fragrances in diffusers that dispense soothing odors\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 to a mobile version that fits into an automobile\u00c2\u00a0cupholder. It connects to an in-car USB port or a cigarette lighter adapted to USB. The Israeli company\u2019s handy diffusers can be controlled by hand, increasing the strength of the\u00c2\u00a0fragrance according to the user\u2019s needs, passions, or\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 presumably\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 speed. The diffuser costs\u00c2\u00a0$139 and a packet of four fragrances, at $29.90, lasts 60 hours per capsule.    Because of the crowd constantly waiting for the Breadbot machine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 developed by the Wilkinson Baking Company of Walla Walla, Wash. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to endlessly churn out perfectly identical loaves of perfect bread, we didn\u2019t get to interview its creators. Suffice to say that, all by itself, it mixes the dough, forms the loaves (in 10 varieties), proofs, bakes and cools ten loaves an hour and informs its largely unnecessary human operator that the bread is ready to slice.    Among the WiFi-connected \u201csmartlock\u201d systems unveiled at CES was a deadbolt and a\u00c2\u00a0porchlight with camera (not pictured). But our favorite Hampton gadget was the already popular BenjiLock, a padlock activated and opened only by its owner\u2019s fingerprint.    The GazeLab Inc. of Seoul has developed a cute desktop robot named Giiro\u00c2\u00a0that monitors the posture of the human at the desk and offers \u201ccoaching\u201d on how to sit. It\u2019s called a \u201csimulation and posture analysis robot with intelligent speakers.\u201d GazeLab also has a Giiro-MAT. The\u00c2\u00a0 user stands on the \u201cspecial posture measurement mat with chiropractic design,\u201d containing 600 sensors and 1.024 levels of pressure and awaits a decision.    Hubert Michaudet and Elodie Grimoin founded Urban Canopee\u00c2\u00a0in the Navier Laboratory of the Ecole des Ponts in Paris as a way of adding greenery, freshening the air and reducing carbon dioxide in otherwise treeless urban settings. The ultra-light composite metal frame set into a big pot grows climbing plants that form a shady oasis in the concrete jungle. The plants are fed with a built-in water reserve and\u00c2\u00a0irrigation system. The Urban Canopee is \u201cplug-and-play,\u201d according to its inventors and can be regulated remotely. And it looks nice.    Another French company, HiTechOne, brought to CES the first personally operated IoT platform, called Modulum. Each unit\u00c2\u00a0is the size and shape of a beloved\u00c2\u00a0French pastry, the\u00c2\u00a0\u201cmacaron.\u201d The mini-IoT platform can be programmed to monitor, for example, every room in a house, turning it into a \u201csmarthome\u201d customized to the needs of the household and operated remotely through WiFi or other forms of wireless access.    Bathed in eerie green light, Volumic\u2019s 3-D printer methodically transforms an image into a three-dimensional object. Volumic, based in Nice, France, has tripled the speed of previous versions of this technology and increased to 50 the\u00c2\u00a0variety of materials in which it can work. Among its application are prototyping, tools, spare parts and miniatures of larger objects. And yes, said Volumic\u2019s co-founder, Gerard Luppino, it can print a gun. But he prefers that it does not.     Jaxjox is a fitness system based on a kettlebell weight that\u00c2\u00a0varies from 12 to 42 pounds, as part of a smart fitness program that\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 synched to the JAXJOX app\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 can guide and monitor the workouts of the whole family. It senses and tracks motion. The system was the subject of a lively interview of\u00c2\u00a0Jaxjox\u2019s Stephen Owusu (right) and journalist Linda Patino of El Tiempo in Bogota, Colombia.  (Source: Jaxjox)    The Spectra-X skateboard, developed by Walnut Technology of Hong Kong, gets to know its skater almost as well as a horse knows its rider. The more it\u2019s used, the more the skateboard learns about the skill level and tendencies of its\u00c2\u00a0user, providing a more responsive and safer experience, according to its creators.\u00c2\u00a0Likewise, if a stranger tries to\u00c2\u00a0climb on, the Spectra-X\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 like a horse\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 tends to be a mite\u00c2\u00a0less cooperative.\u00c2\u00a0But it won\u2019t buck. \u2014 Additional reporting by David Benjamin  More Coverage From CES:   CES:Bright Lights, Sin City AMD Takes Center Stage at CES Big Brother Is Watching You Play Is Robo-Pizza the Next Big Thing?
