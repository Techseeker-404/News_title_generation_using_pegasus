Intel delivered the prototype this week to research partner QuTech (Delft, Netherlands), which will test it on a suite of quantum algorithms to prove the design\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercial relevance.\u00c2\u00a0 Intel entered the quantum computer race in 2015, when it invested $50 million to advance quantum computing in a collaborative development effort with QuTech. The researchers aim to accelerate the development of commercially useful quantum computers by pairing Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CMOS design and manufacturing expertise with QuTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in connecting, controlling, and measuring multiple, entangled qubits. At this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC 2017), the collaborators demonstrated key circuit blocks for an integrated cryogenic-CMOS control system that cools to 20 milli-Kelvin (250 times colder than deep space), presenting their work in a paper titled \u00e2\u0080\u009c15.5 Cryo-CMOS circuits and systems for scalable quantum computing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They have also demonstrated a scalable \u00e2\u0080\u009csurface code\u00e2\u0080\u009d error-correction scheme that enables spatial multiplexing, describing that work in an American Physical Society (APS) paper co-authored by multiple QuTech engineers and David Michalak, a quantum computing researcher-in-residence at Intel.  The research collaborators are working on two parallel efforts to perfect quantum values: a spin-qubit fabrication flow on Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 300-millimeter CMOS process and the packaging advances in the superconducting prototype announced this week. With the new packaging system (see photos), the prototype realizes 17 qubits for quantum computing via an architecture that supports full error correction, improves yield, and boosts performance, according to Intel. Managing the effort at Intel is a duo dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009ca superposition of two Jims\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Intel colleagues: Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware, and Jim Held, director of emerging technology research. (Superposition, the founding principle of quantum computing, is the ability to harness two values \u00e2\u0080\u0094 1 and 0 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 simultaneously in a single qubit.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quantum computer hardware is relatively young, but it is moving fast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clarke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI liken it to the Apollo mission, which against all odds reached the moon in just a few years. Likewise, the Intel-QuTech collaboration is a quick dash to commercial quantum computers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Held said the collaborative program is assembling \u00e2\u0080\u009can entire software stack for quantum algorithms, from qubit operations to the hardware and software architectures required and the quantum applications themselves. In 2016, we built a large-scale qubit simulator with 42 qubits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 since extended to 45 qubits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 running on an Intel supercomputer, so that we have a platform to develop quantum software that is ready for use at the same time our quantum hardware is ready for commercialization.\u201d NEXT PAGE: Architecture Solves Problems Others Experienced\u00c2\u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
