We have to think differently and we have to drive innovation in a very different way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dickerson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point: Whether the principle of brute-force scaling that has driven the semiconductor industry forward for half a century remains viable is immaterial. Everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even those who say that Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law is alive and well \u00e2\u0080\u0094 agrees that scaling alone is no longer enough. Chipmakers need a bigger bag of tricks going forward.   The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest companies, used to upending businesses and altering cultures, are starting to remake the semiconductor industry. What exactly are they doing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so unprecedented, why are they doing it, and what might be the consequences?  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever we did in the past that enabled this incredible innovation \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to work for the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dickerson said during a subsequent interview with EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat has run out of gas. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem is indeed almost universally aligned on the broad strokes of the future of chip building. In addition to continued scaling, new architectures, device structures, packaging technologies, and materials will fuel the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drive toward greater system performance and power efficiency. Dickerson considers these to be the five elements of semiconductor manufacturing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew playbook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because innovation of the future will require not just one knob but several, succeeding with this new playbook is going to require new types of collaboration and new partnerships between companies at previously disparate ends of the manufacturing supply chain and the electronics ecosystem, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this new playbook, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look backward. People may be nostalgic about what we created in the past, but the future\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to look like the past. So I think the companies that can think differently and can connect across the ecosystem better and faster \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 are the companies that are going to be successful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dickerson speaks from a perspective of hands-on experience in semiconductor manufacturing. Early in his career, he spent six years working in fabs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mostly in lithography \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at GM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Delco Electronics Division and AT&T Technologies. He later worked in a number of areas on the equipment side, spending 18 years in inspection and metrology at chip equipment vendor KLA-Tencor and was CEO of ion implementation fab tool vendor Varian Semiconductor Equipment for seven years prior to its acquisition by Applied in 2011. He was appointed president of Applied in 2012 and CEO of the company in 2013, when he was promoted to replace Mike Splinter. And when it comes to the importance of connecting with the ecosystem, Dickerson walks the talk. He estimated that he spent about 20 days traveling in June, meeting with Applied customers around Asia, Europe, and the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including sitting down with the R&D leaders of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top customers in Taiwan, South Korea, and the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love interacting with customers and working together to figure out how we drive innovation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   Gary Dickerson speaks at Applied Materials\u00e2\u0080\u0099 AI Design Forum during Semicon West. (Image: Applied Materials)  The point, he emphasized, is the importance of cross-collaboration and a better understanding of what is needed from a chipmaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective and what is possible from the equipment supplier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI spent many hours with those people really thinking about how we can drive and accelerate innovation. And again, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to think differently, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internally within Applied or across the whole ecosystem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To help stimulate collaboration between Applied and customers, the company last year announced a new facility in upstate New York, dubbed the Materials Engineering Technology Accelerator (META) Center. The 24,000-square-foot facility, which is set to open later this year, will enable customers to work with new materials and develop new processes on Applied tools. Among the big points that Dickerson stresses is the difficulty that chipmakers face in not only creating new processes using new materials for the AI era but refining these processes so that they can be repeatable in the high-volume manufacturing environment of a chip fab. Hardly a week goes by, he noted, that there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a paper published by researchers in a university about novel semiconductor architectures, structures, and materials that suggest the potential for dramatic impact on the semiconductor industry. But while these breakthroughs are impressive, doing something under university research conditions is significantly different than doing it at low cost in high-volume fab conditions.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a lab, you can certainly create architectures that work with certain characteristics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dickerson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut then when you go from the lab to high-volume manufacturing and you want to make billions of those devices \u00e2\u0080\u0094 billions of those structures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at high yield, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole different kettle of fish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This, of course, is where Applied comes in. The breadth of the company \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which has been No. 1 in semiconductor equipment sales nearly every year for the past three decades \u00e2\u0080\u0094 enables Applied to take a more holistic approach to making semiconductor equipment than many of its more narrowly focused rivals, he argues. For example, during Semicon West, Applied introduced new Endura platforms for physical vapor deposition targeting emerging non-volatile memories that are being used in IoT and cloud-computing applications, including MRAM, ReRAM, and PCRAM. These tools, Dickerson emphasized, feature up to nine deposition chambers integrated under vacuum and are capable of precision deposition and control of multi-component materials being used in these memories. These systems illustrate Applied\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breadth, incorporating deposition, thermal, and imaging technologies from across Applied. The semiconductor industry is going to need all of these technologies and more going forward. Among the grand challenges of the AI era that Dickerson sounded the alarm on during his keynote is the enormous power consumption potential of AI data centers, particularly for neural-network training and inference. The adoption rate of AI will be limited unless the semiconductor industry can improve the power efficiency of AI accelerators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the tune of a 1,000\u00c3\u0097 improvement in performance per watt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI is definitely the biggest economic and investment opportunity of our lifetime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dickerson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we also face the biggest challenges from an industry perspective to enable the innovation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Check out all the stories inside this Special Project:   Memory Makers and Foundries Step Up to Hyperscale Demands \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hyperscalers want wholesale architectural changes without paying for the capital equipment needed.  Hyperscalers Getting Competitive with their IC Suppliers Internet platform giants are all interested in custom silicon. Impatient, and with deep pockets, they\u2019re getting more prone to going the do-it-yourself route.  The FANGs & the Foundries As the FANGs design more and more of their own custom chips for AI, they\u2019re getting ahead of traditional semiconductor designers and manufacturers. Something\u2019s got to give.  Tech Titans Beginning to Drive Process Technology Roadmap Locked in an AI arms race and sitting on piles of cash, hyperscalers are beginning to set the agenda in semiconductor process technology.  Semiconductors Swim with Seven Whales  The data center giants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the hyperscale companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are pulling chip designers in many different directions in the search for big markets for big chips.   How Much is Enough for Hyperscale Companies?  The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest companies have upended businesses and altered cultures. Now they\u2019re starting to remake the semiconductor industry. Everybody should be worried. Everybody.   Hyperscale Customers Changing the IC Game  The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest companies, used to upending businesses and altering cultures, are starting to remake the semiconductor industry.
