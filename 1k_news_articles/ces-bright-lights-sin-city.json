I know I should be dazzled, disarmed, and starry-eyed about my seamless, end-to-end, infinitely \u00e2\u0080\u009cconnected\u00e2\u0080\u009d end-user future. Now and then, I am dazzled, like I was by the LG OLED display this year, called the Massive Curve of Nature (see following pages). More often, though, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m nagged by skepticism or wearied by the numbing redundancy of two dozen companies making glitzy (Betty Boop, Hello Kitty, Spiderman) shells for mobile phones or \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 another two dozen companies making driverless shuttle vehicles that seem to have had the same designer. Every one is a box with curved edges and four little soapbox-derby wheels. Inside each is a wall-to-wall TV screen that serves as a sort of visual Muzak. The antidote to my jaded attitude is to roam the show floors with my Pentax in search of interesting images. Most of these, as is my novelistic wont, are characters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people. The following is a sample.  Las Vegas at night (Photo: David Benjamin)   (Photo: David Benjamin)VIRTUAL REALITY GOGGLES have been a CES mainstay for several years. I came upon the Display Link XR wireless VR demonstration and hung around while William Whisnant from NTT Data in Plano, Texas, went through an entertaining series of thrusts, flourishes, and dance steps.  (Photo: David Benjamin)   (Photo: David Benjamin)BOXBOT is a cool boxing device that bobs and weaves while you try to hit it. The character here is a genial L.A.-based Serbian slugger named Vanja Kapetanovic. Boxbot spokesman Alex Golunov noted that the market for this machine, priced at $20,000, is fitness clubs and gyms.    (Photo: David Benjamin) \u00a0 THE CES BLUES. This is just a show-floor scene that appears as your typical conventioneer enters the South Hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center.    (Photo: David Benjamin)GUESS these guys have something other than girls on their minds. In fact, conversations like this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not always in a sales mode \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are a basic element at CES. And there are precious few places to sit down and just talk.    (Photo: David Benjamin)BUT IT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S POSSIBLE. In the midst of the maddening crowd, I found Monica Colespring (left) of ADT in Boca Raton deep in dialog with Srini Pagdyala of Aigo AI in Redondo Beach, California. They were sharing intelligence that did not seem remotely artificial.    (Photo: David Benjamin)DEFINITELY DAZZLING was the FLIR booth, which drew an impressive crowd to a presentation of its thermal imaging technology. Most of this stuff is professional \u00e2\u0080\u0094 used in firefighting, drone operations, and police work, among other applications. But FLIR is now selling a consumer smartphone attachment, perfect for tracking down hot girls (or guys). Besides one eerie shot of spectators caught by a thermal camera, I got a look inside the control booth, which suggests how complicated this stuff is.  (Photo: David Benjamin)  (Photo: David Benjamin)   (Photo: David Benjamin)THERE ARE STILL a few people like me and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Leo Hoarty of Sweetvinyl LLC in Morgan Hill, California who still take notes the old-fashioned way: with paper and pen. The object of Hoarty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest was MAD, the Meituan Autonomous Delivery system. The vehicle involved is a box with curved edges and four little soapbox-derby wheels.  (Photo: David Benjamin)   (Photo: David Benjamin)MIRCOD, according to one of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operation officers, Yitzhak Weiss, is an IoT platform that enables a technology device to measure \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhatever you want to measure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This demonstration of MirCod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working prototype was a \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart boxing glove\u00e2\u0080\u009d connected to a readout display \u00e2\u0080\u009cto show what we can do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The boxer here, earnestly whacking her dummy, is Joey Courtney.    (Photo: David Benjamin)THE TSA FACTOR (thousands sitting around) is one of the more forlorn aspects of the Consumer Electronics Show.    (Photo: David Benjamin)THE SHUTDOWN SIT-DOWN. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a visit to CES without a shot of Consumer Technology Association czar Gary Shapiro lounging in a soft chair, fielding softball questions from a friendly interviewer? Shapiro was free to do this sit-down and sign copies of his new book because his annual interview with FCC chief Ajit Pai was cancelled by the U.S. government shutdown.    (Photo: David Benjamin)THE FLOW of conventioneers at the main entrance to the Las Vegas Convention Center encounters an immediate blast of lights, cameras, action, and distraction.    (Photo: David Benjamin)LG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OLED EXTRAVAGANZA , on a vast bank of curved screens, created a bottleneck of rubberneckers at the entrance to the LVCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central hall. Here are a few samples of the remarkable display.

(Photo: David Benjamin)   (Photo: David Benjamin)SINGSTATION, an \u00e2\u0080\u009call-in-one\u00e2\u0080\u009d karaoke party system, had the excellent taste to hire an excellent singer, Carly Richardson, to run the product through its paces. She deserved a much bigger crowd than the one to which she was singing.    (Photo: David Benjamin)CARS, BOTH AUTONOMOUS and \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcept,\u00e2\u0080\u009d were a big part of CES \u00e2\u0080\u009919. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the gateway to the auto show.    (Photo: David Benjamin)AMONG THE CARS displayed by Kia, including several boxes with curved edges and little soapbox-derby wheels, the brightest lights emanated not from a car at all but from something called a personality mobility device (PMD).
