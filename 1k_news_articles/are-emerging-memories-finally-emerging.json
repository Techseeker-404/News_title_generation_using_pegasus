The report found that the emerging memory market is poised to reach $20 billion of combined revenues by 2029, largely by displacing today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less efficient memory technologies such as NOR flash and SRAM\u00e2\u0080\u0094even displacing a share of DRAM sales. They will also be more competitive with incumbent memory technologies, as future process shrinks and improved economies of scale will drive down prices, enabling adoption both as standalone chips and embedded within ASICs, microcontrollers, and even compute processors. \u00a0  \u00a0  The three key emerging memories to keep an eye on are PCRAM, MRAM, and ReRAM; NOR flash and SRAM are prime candidates to be replaced.

The report pegs the revenue growth of 3D XPoint \u00e2\u0080\u0094 again, PCRAM in the form of Intel Optane \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at $16 billion by 2029, thanks to its sub-DRAM prices. Stand-alone MRAM and STT-RAM revenues, meanwhile, will approach $4 billion, or more than 170 times MRAM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenues in 2018.\u00c2\u00a0 Along with ReRAM, MRAM is expected to compete to replace the bulk of embedded NOR and SRAM in SoCs, fueling even greater revenue growth. Emerging memories cover a breadth of technologies, but the key ones to watch out for are MRAM, PCRAM ,and ReRAM, said Coughlin. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been discrete MRAM devices out for some time, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of talk about foundries building ASICs with specialized chips and replaced volatile memories with non-volatile options, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u2019s going to be one of the big biggest drivers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Handy said NOR flash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inability to scale past 28 nanometers is also shifting attention to alternatives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the past, the only reason to have an emerging memory in an embedded application like on an MCU or on an ASIC is because you needed some technical attributes that it had, but it always added cost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The prospect of being able to replace NOR flash using a smaller process node is spurring interest, he said. \u00a0  \u00a0  The three key emerging memories to keep an eye on are PCRAM, MRAM, and ReRAM as NOR flash and SRAM are prime candidates to be replaced. (Source: Coughlin Associates)  \u00a0 Overall, the economics of the emerging memories are also improving, said Coughlin, as foundries don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily have to add another back-end process but make it a part of the existing CMOS processing, which lowers the manufacturing costs as volumes go up and yield improves. He said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgolden age for MRAM\u00e2\u0080\u009d because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting an opportunity to prove itself in volume as foundries are looking to build it into embedded chips, while PCRAM has some support behind it, thanks to Intel Optane. Meanwhile, ReRAM is getting a lot of attention for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. Even FRAM remains in the mix, as a dark horse contender for some applications. However, Handy believes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early to name a winner,\u00c2\u00a0 and despite the healthy forecast ahead for emerging memory technologies, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still hard for them to get a leg up on entrenched technologies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u2019re really hard to knock out of their leadership position even if the economics are improving. If you\u2019re not the cost leader then all these wonderful technical benefits you have over the entrenched technologies don\u2019t really mean an awful lot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
