And the situation is likely to persist for perhaps years because vendors have delayed investing in additional manufacturing capacity, fearing a repeat of the dot-com boom/bust cycle. While many might consider supply shortages a manufacturing or procurement problem, though, designers are in an ideal position to help find a long-term solution.        Editor's note: The most ubiquitous components in any electronics design \u00e2\u0080\u0094 interconnects, passives and electromechanical (IP&E) devices \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are in the midst of an unprecedented supply shortage. What distinguishes this scarcity from others is the broad base of markets that are desperate for IP&E. AspenCore Media\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Special Projects team is taking a deep dive into everything IP&E: What end markets are gobbling up components? Why isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t capacity being added? Where are prices going? And how did we get here?   The current IP&E shortage is a cause for serious concern. Demand has so outstripped production that common components such as multilayer ceramic chip capacitors (MLCCs), chip resistors, and the like are now seeing lead times of 40 to 60 weeks. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to exhaust any reasonable inventory reserve that a manufacturer might have and result in a shutdown of a production line and corresponding loss of revenue and even market share. These shortages, then, become a company-wide concern, not just a manufacturing or procurement worry. A typical bill of materials (BOM) and component specification control drawings for a design may identify drop-in alternatives for such components, but in current market conditions, that may not be enough to help purchasing acquire the needed parts. Other companies have similar choices, after all, so the competition for alternatives may be nearly as great as for the preferred parts. What manufacturing needs are alternatives to using unavailable parts that are not simple cookie-cutter replacements but, instead, use different component types or values. Identifying and validating such alternatives are best done by the design team. Consider, for instance, trying to find substitutes for the MLCCs that have become popular because of their small size, low cost, and low equivalent series resistance (ESR). Such devices have lead times approaching a year, and the shortages are not expected to begin easing before 2020, so identifying an alternative is essential. Capacitor technologies have different responses to factors such as bias voltage, one of several factors that needs to be accounted for when choosing an alternative. Source: Murata.   If a slight board redesign is a viable option, and the capacitance is not critical (such as a bypass application), it might be possible to simply use a greater capacitance in a larger, less popular, and, thus, more available package size. Another alternative might be to use two lower-value capacitors in parallel to achieve the desired capacitance.

In such cases, another alternative might be to use a different capacitor technology type to replace the MLCC, such as tantalum or aluminum polymer. In these situations, developers will need to dig deeper and explore parameters like voltage rating, ESR, resonance frequency, and leakage current in addition to size and capacitance when choosing an alternative.
