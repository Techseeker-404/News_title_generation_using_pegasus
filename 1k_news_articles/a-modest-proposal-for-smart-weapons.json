Fingerprint sensors on triggers or grips can prevent use of a stolen gun, but they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop an owner gone postal. Embedded sensors are one direction worth exploring. Biologists may be able to identify chemical signatures for rage, depression or schizophrenia. When sensors detect levels above a given threshold, they can lock the weapon. Take it a step further and think about how recent advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence could be harnessed to end gun violence. Imagine handguns and rifles that identify subjects and analyze their intent before they fire on them. Such avenues are ripe for innovation, but they only scratch the surface. Just as forward-looking car makers are developing electric vehicles to replace the combustion engine, engineers need to rethink the gun. A new generation of smart weapons could be a game changer. Gunpowder has a long history, but the future belongs to newer technologies such as lasers. I know this may sound far-fetched, like the phaser from Star Trek. But the fact is the communicators from that futuristic TV show actually did a pretty good job anticipating today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smartphones.   "}
