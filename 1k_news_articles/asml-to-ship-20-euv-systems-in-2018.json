The company's estimates came as part of ASML's second quarter financial report, which included better-than-expected sales of EUV tools and overall sales of about $3.2 billion. \u201cGross margin was slightly above our guidance, reflecting the strength of our DUV and applications business and progress in EUV profitability,\u201d said ASML CEO Peter Wennink.

EUV \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the successor to the workhorse deep ultraviolet (DUV) technology in advanced semiconductor manufacturing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is finally on the cusp of production after years of delays. Leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers include Samsung, Intel and TSMC are planning to use EUV in volume production beginning in the next year, though concerns remain about the availability of the EUV power source and other items in the EUV supply chain, including pellicles. ASML says it has now demonstrated four-week availability of well above 85% on a number of its new NXE:3400B EUV systems and is executing several programs to improve consistent availability to over 90% in 2019. Wennink said ASML's deep-ultraviolet lithography business continues to thrive, driven largely by the memory market, which \u00c2\u00a0continues to require a significant number of lithography systems at least throughout this year and into 2019. After an excellent first half of 2018, we expect the second half. \u201cAfter an excellent first half of 2018, we expect the second half to be stronger, with improved profitability and continued growth from Q3 to Q4,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wennink said. For the third quarter, \u00c2\u00a0ASML said it expects sales of between 2.7 billion and 2.8 billion euro (roughly $3.15 billion to $3.26 billion). \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nitin Dahad is a European correspondent for EE Times.\u00c2\u00a0   EUV Backlog Grows as ASML Sets Sales Record  ASML Continues to Ramp EUV Shipments  ASML Updates EUV Roadmap ASML Revs EUV Engines "}
