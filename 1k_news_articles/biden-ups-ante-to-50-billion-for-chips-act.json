Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal for the chip industry ups the ante from the $37 billion suggested in two measures introduced last year, the\u00c2\u00a0American Foundries Act of 2020\u00c2\u00a0(AFA) and the\u00c2\u00a0Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors\u00c2\u00a0(CHIPS) Act. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Biden believes we must produce, here at home, the technologies and goods that meet today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenges and seize tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the US White House said in a press statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Biden is calling on Congress to invest $50 billion to create a new office at the Department of Commerce dedicated to monitoring domestic industrial capacity and funding investments to support production of critical goods. The President also is calling on Congress to invest $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing and research, as called for in the bipartisan CHIPS Act.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Biden infrastructure proposal is unlikely to have strong bipartisan support. US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized the infrastructure plan as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrojan horse\u00e2\u0080\u009d that hides huge tax hikes that could hurt companies and the upper middle class. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal comes as two Asian chipmakers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and Samsung are expected to widen their lead in the semiconductor industry this year. The combined capital expenditures of Samsung and TSMC in 2021 will reach at least $55.5 billion, IC Insights said in a March research bulletin. That amount for just one year exceeds the proposed $50 billion in the Biden plan, which would be spread out over a period of several years.

Last month, top US chipmaker Intel announced it would dive headlong into the foundry business in competition with TSMC and Samsung, starting with a $20 billion investment in Arizona. New CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company is establishing the contract manufacturing endeavor as a standalone business called Intel Foundry Services. Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not depend on a penny of government support. It is the right strategy for us going forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gelsinger was cited by Reuters as saying. While the US still makes most of the key semiconductor design software and production equipment, companies in Taiwan, South Korea and China produce most of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chips. The increased dominance of the chip industry by Samsung and TSMC has wide-ranging geopolitical and business implications. South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Samsung is within range of a nuclear attack by North Korea. Taiwan is under threat of an armed takeover by China. In the past twelve months, governments in North America and Europe have started efforts to reduce their exposure to fragile supply chains by rebuilding their declining domestic chip industries. The government of India is also offering a $1 billion cash incentive to any investor that commits to building a domestic semiconductor facility, according to Reuters. The amount proposed by President Biden would probably still fall short of the amount necessary to get the US back in the game. Governments would need to spend at least $30 billion per year for a minimum of five years to have any reasonable chance of success, according to IC Insights President Bill McClean. The efforts by governments around the world to build domestic semiconductor supply chains may also result in a glut of manufacturing capacity, undermining profitability, according to TSMC Chairman Mark Liu. Global efforts to develop national self-sufficiency in chip production are \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically unrealistic\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Liu said this week at an event in Taiwan as chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. \u201cIt makes sense that all the major economies hope to bring the chips for infrastructure or defense uses onshore, but to bring a full supply chain back and try to be fully self-reliant is totally not efficient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nikkei Asia cited Liu as saying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat additional capacity could become unprofitable capacity.\u201d Governments will need to work with private-sector companies to kickstart chip production, but at this point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear whether the support will be in the form of incentives to TSMC and Samsung to invest in the US and Europe, funding for domestic manufacturers or a combination of both approaches. Samsung and TSMC have announced plans to invest more in the U.S. while they lobby for government incentives.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
