The low latency and network slicing specifications pave the way for distributed wireless networks that some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest carriers plan to build. The ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) spec will enable a one-millisecond round-trip latency between a user device and a base station, compared to tens of milliseconds today. The next-generation core (NGC) standard opens the door to a mix of virtual services that can share a carrier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying hardware. Observers expect that the 3GPP will complete both Release 15 specs by their mid-June deadline. However, implementing them and their Release 16 follow-ons will be a multi-year process. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cellular networks generally require processing at one of perhaps a dozen large central office locations that big carriers maintain. The two new specs will let carriers build hundreds of smaller distributed nodes that can support a mix of new, old, and more responsive services still being defined. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo far, everyone has been monetizing data rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Smee, a vice president of engineering for corporate R&D at Qualcomm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe challenge of 5G is monetizing latency with new services.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The edge clouds will vary in size from a small closet to a warehouse, containing mostly servers and storage and a cellular base station. For its part, AT&T described its plans for edge clouds in November. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarriers globally are at different stages that range from not thinking about this yet to having all their decisions made and being on an execution path \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of them to be built starting this year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mike Murphy, the CTO for Nokia in North America. Market watchers at Dell'Oro group disagree. \u201cOur view is that the enhanced mobile broadband use case will be driving more than 99 percent of the 5G investments over the next five years, meaning low latency use cases will not be a significant capex driver over the near-term,\u201d said Stefan Pongratz, a senior analyst at Dell'Oro.  For carriers, the shift requires a leap of faith in new services still being defined \u00e2\u0080\u009cand finding partners to make them useful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Smee. The cost decisions loom large. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are big decisions for CTOs about how to restructure their networks; do they have faith in URLLC or not \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it takes years to build these networks, and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build them and your competitors do, you could be left behind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murphy. Technical issues are smaller but not insignificant. For example, network slicing requires using IDs to define and secure services and route them through optimal paths. Besides the new 3GPP standards, edge clouds will need to implement years of work on software-defined networks and ETSI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network functions virtualization specs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively complex because, end-to-end, you want to tune the radio, transport, and core networks, and coordinating all that needs to stay simple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Murphy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe implementation will take time due to this complexity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   The low latency and network slicing efforts cut across work in the 3GPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core divisions.
