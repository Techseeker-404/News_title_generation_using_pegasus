Asian Power Devices (APD) has been the power experts since 1994, with a focus on power electronics and new energy technologies. With world-class technology research and development capabilities, coupled with highly competitive products and services, APD occupies an important position in the global market. APD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core business groups \u00e2\u0080\u0093 power systems, uninterruptible power system (UPS), and new energy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are laser-focused on driving innovation in power products to support the technology of tomorrow. APD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product areas include power supplies, UPS, and solar photovoltaic converters (inverters). Asian Power Devices is constantly in pursuit of the next step in innovative power systems, driving towards a more sustainable and energy efficient future. APD Solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Built for the challenges of today Sometimes, the needs for reliable power are even greater in an uncertain world. If there is anything that has brought the most serious impact and challenge to the current world economic situation and people\u2019s living conditions, it must be the things surrounding COVID-19. COVID-19 has caused the suspension of most commercial activities and a serious threat to our health and safety. The changes brought to our lives are far more than just the superficial status quo, and it has not only greatly promoted the new state of affairs. On the one hand, the home economics and work situation of people have expanded to respond more to the demand for network equipment supply. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, working from home, online meetings and distance learning have become the new normal. This has stimulated a surge in network usage, and there is an urgent need to expand the capacity of switches and routers, which has brought booming family economic opportunities. APD carried out business transformation in 2008, shifting its goal from the general power supply market to a market segment with higher technical barriers. In addition to medical power solutions, APD is also committed to network equipment power solutions. In other words, APD has developed powerful functions in network equipment power solutions. APD specifically designs high-performance and high-reliability open power supplies for leading network equipment manufacturers, provides them with strong support, and helps them grasp the economic opportunities of their homes. The medical field is fast becoming an increasingly important industry for APD power supplies  And on the other hand, the impact on medical places is even more urgent, including ventilators, oxygen concentrators, and respiratory humidifiers. Equipment must ensure that it can maintain a lasting, uninterrupted and stable power supply.  The ventilator is the main application of APD\u2019s medical power supply. Especially for hospitals, having clean and reliable power can be the difference between life and death. To this end, for years hospitals have relied on high-quality power supply related systems. However, the advent of COVID-19 has thrown another variable into the equation for medical professionals. With hospitals encountering massive surges in the number of patients under their care, they simply cannot afford to have issues with the reliability and availability of their power source. Many hospitals are approaching (or even going beyond) maximum capacity, which means that a loss of power would be catastrophic to many more patients. Furthermore, this increase in the number of patients has meant that many more devices and medical systems connected to the hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power grid \u00e2\u0080\u0093 potentially adding a great deal of strain on the system. The toll of COVID-19 on the medical field is certainly not limited to the hospital itself. With this surge in patients comes an increased need for medical equipment. This includes everything from ventilators to hospital beds to personal protection equipment and much more. This increased demand for medical devices and equipment sent a shock wave down the supply chain, where factories are dealing with labor shortages resulting from quarantines and lockdowns. In response, many factories are accelerating their journey towards increased automation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 further driving the need for strong and reliable power sources. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen there is a surge in demand, there is a rise of overvoltage due to backfeeding during peak load operating conditions, especially when a ventilator for critical care pumps air with a high pressure into a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lungs. In view of this, power supply units (PSU) must be able to support higher peak loads for longer periods to ensure the system maintains stable operation. APD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peak power design can effectively reduce power loss, lower PSU operating temperature, and boost reliability. Moreover, its patented overvoltage protection circuit safeguards the system and PSU from damage caused by excess voltage from PSU output,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mark Tang, sales vice president, APD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power system business group, he put forward an example of the necessity of this type of stable power is with ventilators.  APD Medical Power Supplies are designed to protect the PSU from failure resulting from high-frequency 4G/5G signal interference. APD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical power solutions are compliant with IEC 60601 Safety Requirement for Medical Equipment. They have also been certified to meet radio frequency interference requirements in accordance with Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics DO-160G for Airborne Equipment, which is widely considered to be more stringent than medical equipment standards. This means their leakage current is minimal even under normal operating conditions, thereby protecting the PSU from failure resulting from high-frequency 4G/5G signal interference. More importantly, APD has abundant experience in designing power solutions for medical ventilators. Its customized power solutions for global medical ventilator suppliers fully meet their EMI, temperature, and peak load requirements. As a response and strategies to the above problems, in fact, APD has been committed to developing customized power supply solutions for medical equipment and network equipment for many years. The establishment of high-performance and high-reliability power solutions is the goal that APD has adhered to in its ten-year effort. APD continues to enhance its high degree of professionalism in key technologies, and assists global partners in the fight against COVID-19 while expanding the market. To support the mission-critical devices with a stable and continuous power is also matters The other point for the hospitals is to protect their mission-critical devices and support them with a stable and continuous power so that they can maintain reliable operation and keep patients healthy and safe. Asian Power Devices also has the experience and industry knowledge to not only meet the challenges of 2020 head-on, but also provide the medical community with the power products they need in order to provide top-notch care.
