Some donate equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly test equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to universities while some sponsor and provide equipment to STEM programs such as FIRST Robotics. Others organize student design competitions at conferences. This year, the American Association for Engineering Association (ASEE) has awarded its 2018 Excellence in Engineering Education Collaboration Award to Keysight Technologies. The award will be presented on June 26, 2018 at the annual ASEE conference in Salt Lake City.    ASEE cited Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RF & Microwave Industry-Ready Student Certification Program in its decision. The program, used by over 40 universities, requires students to use software to design RF components such as filters, mixers, attenuators, and amplifiers, then demonstrate measurement proficiency using test equipment such as signal sources, signal analyzers, and vector-network analyzers.      Howard R. Appelman, Associate Technical Fellow and Chair of the ASEE Corporate Members Council, presented the Excellence in Engineering Education Collaboration Award to Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Erica Messinger on June 26.

ASEE recognizes companies for their excellence and innovation in either or both collegiate level engineering and technology education and pre-college (K\u00e2\u0080\u009312/K\u00e2\u0080\u009316) programs that inspire interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. The organization gives priority to those companies that go beyond simple business and marketing of their products to those who work with students and faculty.    \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Martin Rowe covers test and measurement for EE Times and EDN.
