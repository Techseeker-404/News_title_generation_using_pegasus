Jean-Guillaume Coutard, instrumentation engineer at Leti, the French technology research institute which is coordinating the Redfinch consortium, told EE Times that the main application initially is for gas leak detection in petrochemical plants, and the other demonstrators expected from the three-year project would be gas analysis in refineries and protein analysis in liquids for dairies.  Jean-Guillaume Coutard  Coutard said the goal of the project is to bring the cost down to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1,000 (about $1,177). The current technology, he said, costs more than 10 times that. \u201cAnd ultimately, if you want to address a large market like smartphones, it needs to come down to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coutard added. The consortium of eight European research institutes and companies, called Redfinch, is looking to overcome the significant challenge of implementing these capabilities in the mid-infrared region (2-20 \u00ce\u00bcm wavelength range), where many important chemical and biological species have strong absorption fingerprints. This allows both the detection and concentration measurement of a wide range of gases, liquids and biomolecules, which is crucial for applications such as health monitoring and diagnosis, detection of biological compounds and monitoring of toxic gases. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite the mid-infrared wavelength region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s importance for a wide range of applications, current state-of-the-art sensing systems in the MIR tend to be large and delicate. This significantly limits their spreading in real-world applications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coutard said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy harnessing the power of photonic integrated circuits, using hybrid and monolithic integration of III-V diode and interband cascade and quantum cascade materials with silicon, the consortium will create high-performance, cost-effective sensors for a number of industries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Partnered Content: Learn why signal chain expertise is Mission Critical for DoD] "}
