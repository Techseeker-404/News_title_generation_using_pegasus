However, far from clear is whether either Samsung or Huawei will be able to catch up with Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iPhone X. Because the bar set by Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TrueDepth camera is so high, Pierre Cambou, activity leader for MEMS and imaging at Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement, predicts that it may take a year or longer for competitors to offer 3D sensing technologies comparable to iPhone X. Unlike the megapixel race of olden days, 3D sensing will be a tougher challenge for most smartphone vendors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because a 3D camera contains myriad components that need to be aligned. It also requires competent supply chain management. Cambou called the 3D camera \u00e2\u0080\u009ca bundle of sub-devices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember Apple iPhone X?\u00c2\u00a0 Companies involved in it include: STMicroelectronics, LG Innotek, Foxconn, ams, Lumentum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As for Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Galaxy S9, some reviewers are already calling its front-facing sensing technology \u00e2\u0080\u009ca disappointment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A CNET story earlier this month said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn in-depth look at Samsung's new biometrics verification system\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and how it stacks up against the iPhone X\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Face ID\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 shows it's not quite safe enough for mobile payments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is because \u00e2\u0080\u009cSamsung's facial recognition system uses a regular camera to create a 2D map of your face, contrasted with Apple's Face ID, which creates a complex 3D scan of your facial pattern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d People were able to fool Samsung's technology on last year's Galaxy S8 by using photos. Apparently, that trick still works with the S9. Leading up to Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s P20 launch scheduled next week, numerous press reports are singling out \u00e2\u0080\u009ctriple cameras\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the new handset\u00e2\u0080\u0099s key feature. Why triple cameras?  Are three cameras better than two? We asked Eran Briman, vice president of marketing and business development at Corephotonics, a market leader in dual-camera technologies. He told us: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTriple cameras are a brand-new territory that's just about to begin and yet to prove its value.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Noting that triple cameras could come in many forms and configurations, he said they could serve different goals. These include \u00e2\u0080\u009clow light performance, zoom, depth, higher resolution, and image quality as a whole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. According to Briman, triple-camera combinations could include a) a color (RGB) camera, a monochrome camera, and a third camera providing either ultra-wide field of view (FoV) or a 2x telephoto narrow FoV; b) a fisheye (ultra-wide-angle) camera, a standard wide camera and a 2x telephoto camera; or c) a standard wide-angle, a 2x telephoto and a 5x telephoto to enable super-zoom capability. He noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOther configurations are also possible, including various image sensors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Briman said. But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of these triple cameras can provide more accurate depth information compared to dual camera designs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Briman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe main reason is the fact that the baseline (distance between the cameras) would be larger, especially cameras one and three. The larger the baseline, the more accurate the depth is (but also the software has greater challenges, dealing with occlusions, synchronization and others),\u00e2\u0080\u009d Briman said. He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlso, by combining information from three cameras, theoretically you could gain better depth information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other words, Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s triple cameras appear to illustrate the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to enhance depth-sensing technology. While no confirmation is available, Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suspected 3D sensing partner is Qualcomm. Last summer, Qualcomm announced that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been working with Himax Technologies to make a fully integrated structured light module (SliM). The San Diego giant said then that its 3D depth-sensing camera module was slated for mass production in the first quarter of this year.\u00c2\u00a0 Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who in 3D sensing  If smartphone vendors are indeed so hot for depth sensing, who are their key technology providers? Before naming names, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a recap on how Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3D camera works. (Source: Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement)   As Yole previously explained, in enabling the front of the iPhone X to identify its owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face and unlock the phone, Apple combined a ToF proximity detector with an infrared \u00e2\u0080\u009cstructured light\u00e2\u0080\u009d camera that can either use uniform \u00e2\u0080\u009cflood\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdot-pattern\u00e2\u0080\u009d illumination. First, the iPhone X combines an infrared camera with a flood illuminator that projects uniform infrared light forward. It then takes images, which, in turn, trigger a face-detection algorithm. This function, however, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to run all the time. The infrared camera linked to the ToF proximity sensor signals the camera to take a picture when it detects a face. The iPhone X then activates its dot pattern projector to take an image. Both the regular and dot-pattern images then go to the application processing unit (APU), which puts them through a neural network trained to recognize the owner and unlock the phone. Yole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cambou noted that no 3D image is computed at this point. The 3D information is contained in the dot-pattern image. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo run 3D applications, the same APU can use another algorithm [that] computes the depth map of the image,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe iPhone X takes advantage of the massive processing power available in the A11 chip, as structured light approaches are known to be computationally intensive. The use of a neural network is the key technology that made it possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
