At the recent 2017 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications in Japan, Globalfoundries outlined  in a technical paper Everspin Technologies\u2019 progress with moving embedded MRAM (eMRAM) forward into the 22nm process node. In a telephone interview with EE Times, Dave Eggleston Globalfoundries\u2019 vice president of embedded memory, said the key breakthrough highlighted in the paper is the ability for eMRAM to retain data through solder reflow at 260 degrees Celsius, and for more than 10 years at 125 degrees Celsius, plus read/write with outstanding endurance at 125 degrees Celsius. This will enable eMRAM to be used for general purpose MCUs and automotive SOCs, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thermal stability has not been there for the magnetic layers. If you solve that data retention problem then it opens up much wider markets,\u201d he added.\u00c2\u00a0 MRAM had demonstrated non-volatility, high reliability and manufacturability in previous technology nodes, Eggleston said, but has been challenged to scale to 2x nm node geometries and BEOL compatibility process temperatures for embedded memories. As outlined in the paper, the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) stack and integration was been optimized for a 400 degree Celsius, 60-minute post-MTJ patterning thermal budget and compatible with CMOS BEOL. The three major foundries are all introducing it as a product and customers are picking up GlobalFoundries\u2019 PDK to started designing for it, said Eggleston. The major fab equipment makers started getting involved several years ago because they believed there was enough business, so the tools are available for deposition and etch of the MTJ. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey invested and developed products in conjunction with large fabs like us and with small companies such as Everspin,\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Eggleston said.\u00c2\u00a0 MCU customers, in the meantime, have started seriously looking at how MRAM can enhance their architectures, said Eggleston. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey get faster write speed and they get higher endurance,\u201d he said. This gives them the capability to use embedded MRAM where they might have previously used SRAM. Eggleston\u00c2\u00a0said the 2x nm node is the sweet spot in terms of circuitry simplicity and manufacturing costs.   GlobalFoundries\u2019 magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) stack and integration was been optimized for a 400 degree Celsius, 60-minute post-MTJ patterning thermal budget and compatible with CMOS BEOL. The market opportunity for eMRAM is not dissimilar to those of other emerging memory technologies as well as incumbents: new high-volume markets include mobility, networking, data centers, Internet of Things (IoT) and automotive, said Eggleston. For Globalfoundries, the latter two are the most relevant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe used to say they were largely the same, but as a foundry we got lots of traction in automotive,\u201d he said. eFlash has been the incumbent embedded memory, but there are many emerging options that can potentially address these markets, said Eggleston. In addition to eMRAM, there is phase change memory (PCM), embedded Resistive RAM (eRRAM), carbon nanotube (CNT) and ferroelectric (FeFET). All have tradeoffs when it comes to retention, efficiency and speed, he said. Both CNT and FeFET show promise, but are too immature, while PCM is too specialized and fading away from embedded applications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMRAM and RRAM both have similar capabilities,\u201d said Eggleston. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u2019re both backend aligned memories so that gives you the ability to pretty easily implement them into a logic process.\u201d Processes include those that require bulk silicon, FD-SOI or FinFET. eFlash is built down into the silicon, he said, and would be more challenging to build into all of those variants. RRAM is a simpler stack, said Eggleston, as there are fewer materials required between the electrodes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt also doesn\u2019t require the same investment in equipment MRAM does,\u201d he said. \u201cMRAM certainly requires unique capital equipment to do that complex stack.\u201d However, he said, RRAM hasn\u2019t shown the ability to provide the data retention, speed, and endurance balance required by the broader market. What MRAM offers over RRAM is versatility, said Eggleston, because its material composition can be tuned between electrodes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can tune it either for great data retention or for really fast write speed and endurance,\u201d he said. This tuneability, he added, will enable Globalfoundries to address the space at advanced nodes previously addressed by eFlash, as well as tune it for speed for use as a non-volatile cache in server processors and storage controllers. \u00e2\u0080\u0094Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.
