At that time, 2.5-Gbps, 5-Gbps, 25-Gbps, and 400-Gbps speeds were in development. Standards for 50 Gbps and 200 Gbps were estimated to arrive between 2018 and 2020. The 2018 Ethernet Roadmap shows that all of these standards are complete, with 400 Gbps electrical announced in January 2018 and demonstrated at OFC 2018.    Several announcements came out around the time of OFC in March 2018 (see below). The latest announcement came yesterday as the UNH-IOL announced testing services for 50-Gbps, 100-Gbps, 200-Gbps, and 400-Gbps Ethernet, based on IEEE 802.3bs (electrical) and 803.2cd (optical) standards.     What makes 802.3bs and 802.3cd standards different from previous Ethernet standards is that they specify the use of PAM4 modulation, which doubles with bit rate of the traditional non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modulation. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because PAM4 uses four amplitude levels instead of two (Fig. 1). See \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fundamentals of PAM4\u00e2\u0080\u009d for more information.     Fig. 1: A PAM4 modulated signal has four amplitude levels and three eyes.       PAM4 has been a topic at DesignCon for years and has now reached IEEE standards (802.3cd should be ratified soon). EE Times spoke with UNH-IOL Ethernet and Storage Technical Manager Mike Klempa about the announcement.    "}
