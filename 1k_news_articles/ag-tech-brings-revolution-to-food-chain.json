We already have tools and devices to sense, measure and collect data from soil, crops and livestock. Fortunately, for developers and suppliers of ag tech, there are no better customers than farmers. By the nature of their work, farmers become skilled tinkers, and they are readily progressive about embracing new high-tech tools and devices. They are fearless and enthusiastic. However, farmers are also impatient because they need results for the next harvest. We designed this Special Project to illustrate how agriculture technology is bringing fundamental changes to the food chain. In the following stories, we explore advancements in agriculture tech, while examining the new challenges that farmers face. Check out all the stories inside this Special Project on \u2018Agriculture Tech.\u2019     Making Agriculture More Precise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Bountiful Growers are up against it these days. Milk prices have cratered for dairy operations, corn and soybeans farmers are being squeezed by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade war with China. What to do?    Sensors, Networks Enable Precision Agriculture The proliferation of IoT technologies along with data analytics is dropping the cost of sensor-based crop, livestock, and resource management practices known as precision agriculture.    Can Drones Provide Agricultural \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ground Truth\u00e2\u0080\u0099? Early adopters of agricultural drones like the convenience but have trouble managing all the field data their sensors generate.      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
