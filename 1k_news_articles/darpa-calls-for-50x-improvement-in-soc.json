The program calls for the use of monolithic 3D to overcome the current weakest link in computers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the memory wall. This is illustrated in the following slides:     Leading to the 3DSoC solicitation was work done by Stanford, MIT, Berkeley and Carnegie Melon, summarrized in the following two slides.     Proposals are due by Nov 6. Everyone has a unique opportunity to hear an invited talk about the program on October 16 from the 3DSoC DARPA Program Manager, Dr. Linton Salmon during this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IEEE S3S conference at the Hyatt Regency at the San Francisco Airport. The IEEE S3S conference has dedicated focus on monolithic 3D technologies. 3D integration is considered expensive and monolithic 3D is considered extremely challenging requiring high technology, investment, and major changes to the foundry process. In an interesting entanglement, the S3S 2017 program includes a paper by us, MonolithIC 3D Inc., in which we will present a monolithic 3D technology that is low cost and ready to be rapidly deployed using the current transistor processes. In that talk we will also describe how such an integration technology could be used to improve performance and reduce power and cost of most computer systems, suggestive of a 1,000x total system benefit. I hope to see you there to talk further about this upcoming disruptive change. \u00e2\u0080\u0094Zvi Or-Bach is the founder of Zvi Or-Bach is the founder of MonolithIC 3D Inc..
