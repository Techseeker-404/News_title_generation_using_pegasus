A screen shot of CBS news  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fire truck had been parked in the left emergency lane and carpool lane, blocking off the scene of a previous accident, with a California Highway Patrol vehicle behind it and to the side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the Mercury News. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened the investigation into the matter. The safety board sent two investigators to Culver City on Tuesday, while NHTSA confirmed Wednesday that it is also dispatching a special team \u201cto investigate the crash and assess lessons learned.\u201d The use of Autopilot, reported by the Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdriver\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 although this remains unconfirmed by a third party\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 appears to have gotten the federal agencies interested in the case. Details remain sketchy and there are a lot of unanswered questions, since Tesla and authorities have gone mum. Nonetheless, Tesla holds the key to data that could reveal what exactly happened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesla can give NTSB a ton of information because of the black box recording they do with those vehicles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for VSI Labs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known that each Tesla has an SD card that stores all data onboard. Tesla also can access this information by connecting wirelessly with the car, unless the media unit or on board LTE are damaged. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if you do retrieve the SD card,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Magney said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will not give you the information the NTSB needs. Only Tesla can provide this, as it is highly encrypted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We asked automotive experts to weigh in with the questions raised in their minds\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially related to Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advanced driver assistance system (ADAS).\u00c2\u00a0 Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with what we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know for sure. Autopilot  Magney told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually know if Autopilot (AP) was active or not. The driver might be blaming the accident on AP like that Minnesota case from several months ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a Minnesota crash last July, the human driver initially blamed Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Autopilot, but later recanted. Traffic-Aware Cruise Control  Mike Demler, senior analyst at the Linley Group, reminded us that \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutopilot\u00e2\u0080\u009d is actually a package of features. They include Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Auto Lane Change. \u201cIf the driver had adaptive cruise control on, I believe that a well-designed system should have detected the stoppage (in the high-speed lane apparently), but Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owners manual warns that it\u00c2\u00a0 may not.\u201d The Tesla's owners manual states:\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWarning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control can not detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 mph (80 km/h) and a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary vehicle or object, bicycle, or pedestrian is in front of you instead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  So assuming adaptive cruise was on, it apparently gives priority to the radar and not the cameras to detect objects, Demler theorized. \u201cThat would be a software and sensor-fusion problem,\u201d he said.\u00c2\u00a0 Did AEB save the driver?  Magney wonders if Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) was activated or not. He told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Tesla cars, the driver can deactivate this function!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Given the car was traveling at 65 mph, this was a big hit on a very large fire truck. The impact could have severely injured the driver. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is possible AEB mitigated the crash a bit and this how the driver could survive this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Magney hypothesized.\u00c2\u00a0 Did sensors work?  Magney said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this was a late model S it would have a more sophisticated set of sensors, mainly camera and radar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe radar should have picked this up since it was in the path of the vehicle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0  Phil Magney "}
