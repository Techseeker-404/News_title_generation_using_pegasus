In theory, with no need to surround itself with complex analog circuits to boost signals, a photodiode can be simply dropped into a wearable SoC and connect straight to digital circuits, saving both size and the cost of silicon. ActLight, a startup founded in 2011 in Lausanne, Switzerland, has devised \u00e2\u0080\u009cDynamic Photodiode (DPD)\u00e2\u0080\u009d technology and is offering its IP under license to other companies.\u00c2\u00a0 Serguei Okhonin, Actlight's CEO, told EE Times that his company recently picked up \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the top five semiconductor companies\u00e2\u0080\u009d as its first licensee. Okhonin, however, is not yet disclosing the chip vendor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name.   The photo above shows a working sample of ActLight's Dynamic PhotoDiode (DPD). The chip is in the middle, with standard LEDs placed on each side. (Source: ActLight) "}
