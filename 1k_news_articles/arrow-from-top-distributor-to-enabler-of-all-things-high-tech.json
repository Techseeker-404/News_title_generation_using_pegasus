Victorious and, for the first time, alone. CEO Michael Long should savor the moment. Except, he has loftier goals. Arrow wants to be a solutions and technology platform offering data, design, engineering, product development, software, supply chain and other services to the global economy.\u00c2\u00a0(Full disclosure: EETimes is owned by AspenCore, a division of Arrow Electronics).\u00c2\u00a0 This is beyond electronics and high-tech. It is about enabling the efficient deployment of technology to achieve corporate goals, irrespective of an enterprise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic segment. The ambition is broad. In the last decade, Arrow doubled its revenue and is now a $26 billion company, closing in on $30 billion by the end of 2018. Another doubling of its sales in the next decade is believable considering the dramatic expansion of Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s addressable market. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put a number on the TAM (total addressable market). Technology is barging through all doors and getting injected into all products, creating massive opportunities for companies like Arrow that want to make it easier for enterprises to transform their operations using the latest advancements in electronics. Long doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the company can fully tap the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TAM during his lifetime, but he is determined to put a dent in it by transforming into a data, software, hardware and product company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care how the customer wants to deal with us along as they deal with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Long added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will put systems in place to deal with them anyway they want to deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Sponsored: Learn more about Computer Vision for the Masses] Arrow is more than half-way there. With more than 5,000 engineers, Arrow is obviously more than a components distributor. It is one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest engineering companies. It leads in the distribution of software, computer, data and storage equipment and is a top provider of supply chain management services. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer base has ballooned in the last several years to more than 150,000 as it embraced opportunities outside the traditional electronics industry by servicing non-engineering companies in fields as diverse as agriculture, banking and finance, industrial equipment, insurance, manufacturing, and wood and paper mill. Michael Long, Arrow Electronics CEO  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are bringing software support, hardware support and manufacturing support,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Long in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do complete designs for customers, offer manufacturing support and pick the semiconductors and passive components that go into the products so that they are designing with something that is not going to go obsolete tomorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Arrow sees opportunities everywhere and seeks them out with the ferocious passion of an enterprise determined to redefine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and elevate its position\u2013 in the electronics world. Queried that Arrow might be charged with trying to overwhelm rivals so totally that it could take over the market by becoming indispensable to designers, Makers and OEMs/EMS providers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 essentially the same accusation of aiming to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorner the market\u00e2\u0080\u009d that has been levelled against Apple and Amazon.com \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Long unhesitatingly dismisses the charge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there something wrong with that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Long countered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou either eat or you get eaten in this business; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not for the faint of heart. Every day people are out scraping and scrapping to get the advantages that they possibly can and my job and Arrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job is to bring that to our customers so that they can be successful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
