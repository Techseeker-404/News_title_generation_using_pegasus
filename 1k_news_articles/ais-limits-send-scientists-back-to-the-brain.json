Although many scientists and engineers have been intrigued by that notion since the dawn of artificial intelligence in the mid-1950\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, AI research has gone through \u00e2\u0080\u009cwaves of up and downs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Barbara De Salvo, CEA-Leti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief scientist. However, now, the time has come to take brain-inspired technologies seriously. At least, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should recognize there are other existing paradigms, which are useful [for us] to ask good questions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said De Salvo in an interview with EE Times, after she delivered her keynote speech at the Internation Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) here Monday (Feb. 12). \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout new computing paradigms and algorithms, the industry is finally hitting the wall\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it tries to meet more stringent power consumption requirements, she warned.\u00c2\u00a0 Although the industry has been pushing embedded AI platforms, such as Movidius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Myriad 2, Mobileye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EyeQ5 and Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Xavier, she pointed out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still far from where we need to be\u00e2\u0080\u009d to meet the demand for end devices that can process lots of analytics on the edge but use lots less power.
