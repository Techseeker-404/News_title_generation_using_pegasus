The state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co. is in talks with government agencies and corporations, targeting the new financing, according to press reports, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Under the reported plan, the fund would begin disbursing money in the second half of 2018. More money may not be enough to jumpstart China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s semiconductor industry, according to Bill McClean, president of market research firm IC Insights. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the Chinese have plenty of money to spend, they are lagging severely on the technology to be competitive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McClean told EE Times. The goals of the new funding effort have almost no chance of success without strong results in both funding and technology, he said.\u00c2\u00a0 Each of those factors will have equal weight on the final outcome, he added. The new funding effort would follow earlier footsteps of the China IC Industry Investment Fund, created three years ago to bootstrap domestic chipmakers that remain generations behind the global semiconductor industry in production capacity and process technology. The investment fund has disbursed a total of 106 billion yuan, or about 77 percent of the amount allocated for its first stage. The fund has attracted an additional 350 billion yuan from regional governments and the private sector. That earlier injection of money has led to the creation of memory chipmakers such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC) and acquisitions of assembly and test companies such as Singapore-based STATS ChipPAC. Even so, attempts to acquire other overseas semiconductor companies such as Lattice Semiconductor have been blocked by the United States on national security concerns. In the meantime, China has been on the sidelines while the global semiconductor industry has undergone mergers and acquisitions worth hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years, a consolidation that left a smaller number of big companies dominating the industry. The biggest winners from China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new money outlay may be chip equipment makers like Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TEL) as the nation builds as many as ten new fabs making chips on 12-inch wafers, according to analysts surveyed by EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spends will be a positive catalyst,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Mark Li, an analyst with Bernstein in Hong Kong. He said TEL has been gaining market share in China. "}
