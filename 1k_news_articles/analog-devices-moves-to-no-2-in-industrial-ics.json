Texas Instruments remained the leading supplier of industrial chips. Overall, the industrial semiconductor market grew by 11.8% last year to reach $49.1 billion, said IHS. Demand for industrial equipment was broad-based, with continued growth in commercial and military aircraft, LED lighting, digital signage, digital video surveillance, and other markets, said the firm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe resilient economy in the United States and strong demand in China carried the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of industrial equipment demand in 2017,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robbie Galoso, associate director and principal analyst for industrial semiconductors at IHS Markit, in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA European resurgence also provided a strong tailwind for semiconductor growth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d IHS forecasts that the industrial chip market will continue to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 7.1% through 2022.   Each of the top 10 industrial semiconductor suppliers posted growth last year, said IHS. The top 10 suppliers after TI and ADI were, in order: Intel, Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Micron Technology, Toshiba, Microchip, ON Semiconductor, and NXP Semiconductors, according to IHS. No Chinese firms were among the top 10 suppliers of industrial semiconductors last year. However, IHS noted that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s massive investments in LED manufacturing are beginning to pay off, with Chinese firm MLS increasing sales by 50% last year to reach $1 billion, moving the company up five spots to reach 13th in the industrial chip market. MLS beat out other leading general lighting LED suppliers Nichia, Osram, and Cree, said IHS. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
