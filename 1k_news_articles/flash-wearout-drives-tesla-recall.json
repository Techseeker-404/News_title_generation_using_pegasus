The recall was prompted by problems with the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device that Tesla used in its massive touchscreen displays on most 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932018 Model S sedans and 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932018 Model X SUVs. These chips eventually wear out, a problem previously reported by Motherboard back in 2019, which leads to the entire \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedia control unit\u00e2\u0080\u009d being bricked and cutting off access to not only the backup camera, which is now federally required, and affects everything else routed through the touchscreen, including HVAC controls and even turn signal lights. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) asked Tesla to issue the recall a year ago, but Tesla wanted to try to fix the problem through a software update; that effort failed. The auto maker finally acceded to issuing a recall last week. In a separate interview with EE Times, Missy Cummings, professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, called Tesla\u2019s recent recall \u201cplanned obsolescence.\u201d One industry observer, however, speculated that the programmers of Tesla\u2019s large displays might not have known that there are wear issues with flash. Wear and tear That NAND flash wears out is nothing new, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a great deal of innovation around the technology in the last decade to improve its endurance, reliability and longevity, and that includes the eMMC, an embedded mass storage device that integrates the NAND flash memory, controller and interface in one package.

This is specified in each product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data sheet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jim Handy, principal analyst with Objective Analysis. Chip companies would have advised Tesla in their data sheet as to the endurance ratings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese ratings tend to be extraordinarily conservative, sometimes even specifying wear that is more than 100 times less than the device actually tolerates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said the Tesla hardware engineers who chose the eMMC in question would have understood the NAND flash rating, but somewhere between them and the programmers there was a lack of communication about wear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey probably did a good job of balancing reliability, endurance, and price, as all automakers do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Handy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut perhaps they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t establish limitations on the programmers, who should have had some input to the selection process, and perhaps motivation (from management) to consider wear issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probable that the programmers never knew that there are wear issues with flash, he said. Jim Handy The general rule of thumb in automotive is that components such as memory chips should be able to last a decade, so that on average, the vehicle doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t outlive them. Given that some of the vehicles in the latest Tesla recall were 2012 models, one could expect that some problems with displays running on eMMC that were 10 years old. And while there are boutique flash makers make SLC eMMCs that wear 10-plus times as long, said Handy, these devices often cost ten times as much as mainstream products. Automotive grade Even though Tesla wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spending a premium for eMMC devices, they would have been automotive grade, he said, and should have lasted their specified lifetimes of about 10 years at extreme temperatures; the failure was likely due to the design of the large displays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe issue is the amount of times the flash was being overwritten.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite all advances in vehicle infotainment systems, including advanced driver information systems (ADAS) and cameras becoming standard on pretty much any new vehicle, NAND flash is still somewhat new in automotive applications, said Handy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarmakers are learning as they go. Everyone will learn from this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Anthony Le, vice president of marketing at Macronix America, agrees that Tesla will learn from this bump in the road, but also believes the company is thinking less like a traditional automaker and more like a software/technology company. And unlike traditional carmakers, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more focused on pushing the envelope and can more easily afford a recall because it has much fewer cars on the road. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also important to realize that not all eMMC devices are put together the same way. Macronix, for example, supplies the automotive segment with a variety of flash products, such as NOR flash and NAND flash eMMC devices, including any necessary controllers, which are a big factor when it comes to how well the flash performs and endures, he said. If the device is a patchwork of different suppliers, including controllers, the different components of the eMMC devices may not be as fully tuned as they could be to maximize the lifespan of NAND flash. The fact that Tesla display devices are quite large, said Le, means there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of power and heat flowing through the system. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe higher the temperature, the faster the wear-out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why auto qualified components are certified for higher temperatures as to extend the useful life of the NAND, but the quality of the NAND is also a variable in the lifespan of an eMMC device, he said. The difference between the cycles available from SLC NAND and TLC NAND are significantly different, for example, and the controller must be properly tuned for each type, especially in an automotive environment. In addition, not every NAND flash is exactly the same because there are different manufacturers. Anthony Le While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a relatively new technology in automotive applications, the eMMC for factor is quite mature, and Le said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to have a long road ahead of it despite predictions it would be supplanted by Universal Flash Storage (UFS). It makes sense that UFS would find traction in consumer devices such as smartphones, which tend to have a lifespan of two to three years, but it will be a while before it makes significant inroads in automotive, he said. In the meantime, Tesla has emailed owners of the recalled vehicles that it will upgrade the eMMC chip free of charge with what it said is an enhanced 64GB eMMC when the parts become parts become available, and that customers should only schedule a service appointment if their vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s display bricks or they get an alert about the memory storage. EE Times reached out to Tesla for comment, but the company did not respond in time to meet our deadline. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently an overall chip shortage affecting automakers, but memory chips specifically aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in a dire one, said Handy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat distinction belongs to more rudimentary chips that are still being made on 200mm wafers at processes larger than 0.25\u00c2\u00b5m.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Imagine being unable to make a car because some 10-cent chip becomes unavailable, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe cheaper the chip, the more dire the shortage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.
