It is unclear what the impact of the ruling will be. Apple maintains that the order pertains only to iPhones running the legacy iOS 11 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an assertion that Qualcomm disputes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and said that all iPhone models remain available for sale in China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe orders aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specific to the operating system installed on the phones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dan Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general counsel and executive vice president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple made similar arguments in the trial on the merits, and the court went forward and issued these orders. If Apple is violating the orders, Qualcomm will seek enforcement of the orders through enforcement tribunals that are part of the Chinese court system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The ruling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 issued by the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Court in China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the latest chapter in the ongoing feud between Apple and Qualcomm, the longtime supplier of the baseband modem used in iPhones. Since a dispute over licensing fees last year, the two companies have traded lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions, with billions of dollars potentially at stake. Apple chose to use a modem supplied by Intel in its latest iPhone models, the XS and XS Max. In September, a U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) judge found that iPhones violate a Qualcomm patent but declined to recommended a ban on iPhones in the U.S. A final determination by the ITC is expected early next year. According to Jim McGregor, principal analyst with Tirias Research, the Fuzhou court ruling may force Apple to the bargaining table. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this being just the first of many court cases in China, Germany, and the U.S., this is likely to push Apple for a resolution as soon as possible even as it files an appeal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said McGregor in an email exchange with EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple has now lost with the ITC and a China court. If not, Apple faces both a significant financial and market share impact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Romit Shah, managing director and senior analyst in global market research at Nomura Instinet, agreed, saying that the preliminary injunction by the Fuzhou court \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaves a path toward settlement\u00e2\u0080\u009d between Apple and Qualcomm. Shah added that China \u00e2\u0080\u009ctends to be politically motivated\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said that the Fuzhou ruling against Apple \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the largest U.S. company \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could be seen as retaliation for the recent arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief financial officer in Canada at the request of the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is set to decide on more than 20 patent disputes [between Apple and Qualcomm], and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see why the rulings would be in favor of Apple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Shah in a report. The Qualcomm patents at issue enable consumers to adjust and reformat the size and appearance of photographs and to manage applications using a touchscreen when viewing, navigating, and dismissing applications on their phones, said Qualcomm. In a statement, Apple said that Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to ban iPhone sales in China is \u00e2\u0080\u009canother desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Apple also claimed that Qualcomm is asserting three patents against Apple that it never raised before, \u00e2\u0080\u009cincluding one which has already been invalidated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Apple said that it would pursue all legal options through Chinese courts. Shah said that Apple would almost certainly file with the Fuzhou court for reconsideration but added that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unlike in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 injunctions in China typically remain in effect during the appeal process. Shah also said that the ruling relates to the use of touchscreen and camera firmware, which he believes have nothing to do with iOS versions. He estimated that roughly 15 to 20 million iPhone units would be impacted.      Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
