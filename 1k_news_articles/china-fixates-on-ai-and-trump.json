My friend started her career as an engineer in China and is now on a business development/management track at a technology company based in Shanghai and Silicon Valley. The first question I asked her was: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat has changed China since last I saw you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Without hesitation, she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI and Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the United States, artificial intelligence and a president whose intelligence has been questioned by his own staff would seem to be unrelated topics. However, in China, at least in the technology community, they are closely intertwined.  David Yang, ZGMicro "}
