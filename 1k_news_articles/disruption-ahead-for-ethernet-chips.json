This signals the clear future trend.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 A prominent way forward for chip design is increasingly defined by the transition away from network switch ASICs\u2013dependent mainly on TSMC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s process node technology\u2013to multi-chip or \u00e2\u0080\u009cchiplet\u00e2\u0080\u009d architectures. This evolution will shake up big silicon vendors such as Broadcom and Cisco who have done business in much the same way for years.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The fact that the switch has already been disaggregatedin the cloud for nearly a decade means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now time for silicon to follow a similar mindset. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 12.8 Tbps fabrics may offer a glimpse of this, but the next-generation 25.6 Tbps fabrics will have multiple ASIC vendors trying new architectures.  The implementation of multiple chips, along with programmability capabilities offers increased flexibility and lower costs, all while meeting performance requirements.\u00c2\u00a0Just as importantly, the movement will drive costs down as speeds go much higher, with 400Gbps as the next standards benchmark and bandwidth doubling every 18 months.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 [Partnered Content: How WinBond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NOR Flash memory can apply block protection to almost an entire array] Today a raft of start-up vendors are spearheading the efforts including Barefoot Networks, Innovium and Nephos are providing customer tested silicon. A key to their success will be the adoption of a programmable forwarding plane that does not compromise performance.\u00c2\u00a0 In addition, serdes will evolve at a different pace and process node then the actual switch chip, making chip design faster and more modular.\u00c2\u00a0The transition will open a door for the integration of onboard optics and chip speeds that achieve above 25.6 Tbps, again lowering costs to customers. Chips also will adopt short-trace serdes and embrace silicon photonics.\u00c2\u00a0 Design considerations for switch chips will include on-chip monitoring and testing features, providing intelligence to support a good range of routing requirements to meet high speed applications in the data center.\u00c2\u00a0 Meanwhile, software such as P4 is enabling on the fly chip programmability, serving multiple markets from cloud to data center and more.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 By separating out components such as serdes, designers will be able to get around issues with Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law, innovating different circuitry at different speeds and allowing multichip solutions to come to market quickly.\u00c2\u00a0As an added benefit, these disaggregated chips will enjoy better yields. \u2014 Alan Weckel is founding analyst of the 650 Group.\u00c2\u00a0  "}
