Below, we share what we see as the top five pivotal events from 2019 that are likely to have significant ramifications on 2020. The rebirth of ultra-wideband (UWB) The introduction of the U1 ultra-wideband (UWB) chip in Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest iPhone launch was a significant event not just for Apple, but for the whole industry. Several companies that are actually in the market right now include: NXP Semiconductors, Decawave, 3db Access, and Hella, one of the developers of UWB-based keys. UWB, once pitched as a high-speed connectivity technology, has transformed itself as a sensing technology: It can now offer very precise device positioning information. SPONSORED: The future of smart devices: contextual awareness While Apple has not yet enabled any services using UWB, the chip industry sees Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move as the big break that the technology needs for mass adoption. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already used in a Jaguar Land Rover to prevent relay station attacks (one of the most common causes of car theft in new cars with key fobs); hence car manufacturers like Volkswagen are looking to deploy the technology more widely for secure smart digital keys and other smart mobility services.  UWB enables data to be transmitted over a short range and wide bandwidth, which lends itself to accurate positioning information, even in congested multi-path signal environments.

We have also observed that both IoT and automobiles are looking to leverage 5G in hopes of creating a huge opportunity for their respective connected applications. They are the two market segments that are clearly getting on every big chip company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top agenda. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why chipmakers have been opening up their checkbooks with big figure acquisitions to bolster connectivity. Such examples include Infineon buying Cypress Semiconductor for $10 billion, Nvidia acquiring Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion, and NXP acquiring Marvell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity assets for $1.76 billion. Arm now allows some customization Earlier in the year, we published a piece that suggested some in the industry wondered how Arm would respond to the RISC-V challenge. In February, we learned that the company was already in the process of addressing the issue, but it took several months before Arm made any public announcements on the topic. Arm used the company\u2019s own TechCon 2019 to reveal that it would be opening up its instruction set to customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 customized instructions for Cortex-M cores. While Arm is clearly the highest volume 32-bit RISC core shipping in the market, this customization could help gain a foothold in the market led by other intellectual property (IP) companies that have succeeded with customizable instruction sets. They include: ARC (now part of Synopsys) and Tensilica (now part of Cadence).

This requires manufacturers of connected devices for sale in California to equip the devices with \u00e2\u0080\u0098reasonable\u00e2\u0080\u0099 security features. Hence the announcement of OpenTitan, an open source silicon root of trust, is viewed as critical. The move will make it easier for developers to design trusted security into their systems at the metal level. We see this likely to be a pivotal moment for embedded security and IoT. As a coalition between ETH Zurich, G+D Mobile Security, Google, Nuvoton Technology, and Western Digital, and managed by an independent, not-for-profit company lowRISC CIC (Cambridge, U.K.), OpenTitan said its open source approach overcomes the issue of having to put blind trust in many of the proprietary hardware root of trust solutions currently available.  OpenTitan founding partners (Source: OpenTitan) RISC-V gaining traction As we attended various conferences, we found heterogenous processing solutions often getting deployed in the market \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether for edge processing or for high-performance computing. The emergence of RISC-V has certainly been critical in 2019. Take the example of Alibaba\u2019s announcement in July. The Chinese company will enable a new 16-core RISC-V chip \u00e2\u0080\u0094 targeting artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and 5G \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with 40% more performance than existing RISC-V cores. There are of course many other initiatives in RISC-V that suggest a gradually maturing ecosystem. One good example is the OpenHW Group offering hardened system on chips (SoCs) based on the processor core. In addition, we\u2019ve seen individual firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 initiatives such as Andes Technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s program, enticing developers to try its RISC-V cores for free with no upfront IP licensing fees.
