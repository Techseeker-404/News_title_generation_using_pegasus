It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an old technique and one that GlobalFoundries (GF) used when it announced its change of CEO last week. A skeletal announcement, no interviews, and, with the weekend at hand, little time to think about it. That made me want to think about it. Perhaps obsess is a better word. First, I noted that CEOs often are said to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstep down\u00e2\u0080\u009d as part of a mutual agreement. We all know the reality is that people usually either quit or are fired. If Sanjay Jha quit, it could be because he was offered a more attractive job. One commenter speculated that he might be offered the CEO job at Qualcomm. The idea is kind of crazy, like jumping from the frying pan to the fire given Broadcom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm. Still, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible given that Qualcomm is pulling out all the stops to prevent the takeover, and its current CEO is said to be scoring low among candidate board members in the early proxy ballots. In some ways, the scenario makes sense because Jha used to be the COO of Qualcomm. If Qualcomm gets China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval to acquire NXP, which owns a bunch of fabs, Jha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience at GF would be welcome. Another scenario is that Jha quit because he was fed up. This is very plausible given that GF has gone through four CEOs now in less than a decade. GF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sole owner, the Mubadala Investment Co. in the United Arab Emirates, is said to be a tough boss, reportedly a former CEO felt hemmed in by handfuls of McKinsey analysts that Mubadala hired, creating an environment of paralysis by analysis. If Jha was fired, it could have been because he was not hitting his marks. As a former Qualcomm and Motorola Mobility exec, he was expected to help GF win deals to make Snapdragon and other big, high-volume chips. To date, the foundry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest-named customers are still its former parent AMD and IBM, whose chip unit it acquired in 2015. So this scenario seems plausible. "}
