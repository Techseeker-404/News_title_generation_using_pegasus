Prices of rare earths are surging as news media report (here and here) that China may again use the materials as a weapon in the trade war with the US. Shortages of the raw materials would further impact electronics supply chains already constrained by a dearth of chips that started last year.  Recommended:  The Politics of Rare Earth Metals  Despite a US initiative by President Joe Biden to support so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreen energy\u00e2\u0080\u009d mining, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely that the nation will increase rare earth production significantly during the next four years, according to Black, in an interview with EE Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u2019re ten years away from even coming close to having a fully diversified supply chain. To open a mine is not like building a factory. To open a mine can take three to four years of planning, then permits for two years and another three years if everything goes smoothly, which it rarely does, then two years to build. You\u2019ve already spent eight years before you\u2019ve even started production.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated, the tiniest factors can have a huge impact on globally stretched supply chains and national economies. China is not likely to weaponize rare earths, but instead may take a more nuanced approach to its exports, Black says. \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0099Weapon\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is too strong a term because it implies pistols at dawn. We\u2019ve diplomatically evolved somewhat in the last 200 years where the fear of the unknown is often more important than the fear of the known. When you have a mechanism where you could restrict the export of rare earths, that in turn is probably far more powerful than actually restricting them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d China will go to great lengths to maintain overall control of the global rare-earths supply, retired U.S. Navy admiral James Stavridis said in a Bloomberg Opinion column. That strategy seems to be aimed at allowing just enough supply to keep the threshold for entry by competitors high, he said. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an idea similar to that used by Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain their cartel. To be sure, Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of rare earths as a political tool made headlines in 2010 amid a heated dispute with Tokyo. After Japan arrested the captain of a Chinese fishing boat that rammed a Japanese Coast Guard vessel in the waters near the contested Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, China restricted rare earth exports to Japan for two months. China is again ramping up the dispute over the islands. Flexing strength More recently, China flexed its rare earth strength against the US. Amid the US-China trade war, Chinese President Xi Jinping\u00c2\u00a0visited\u00c2\u00a0a rare earth facility in Jiangxi province in May 2019, sending a warning to the US. A People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily\u00c2\u00a0article hinted that China could cut exports to the US as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccounter weapon\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the trade war. Days later, Beijing\u00c2\u00a0raised\u00c2\u00a0tariffs on US rare earths from 10 to 25 percent. The US defense industry has a huge appetite for the minerals. According to the\u00c2\u00a0Congressional Research Service, each US F-35 fighter jet needs about 427 kg (941 pounds) of rare earths, and each Virginia-class nuclear submarine, about 4.2 metric tons. As of 2019, China still produced roughly 85 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s processed rare earth oxides and approximately 90 percent of rare earth metals, alloys and permanent magnets, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington DC think tank. The US dependence on China may persuade the two nations to hit the pause button in their trade war. America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest companies also depend on the minerals. One example is the Apple iPhone. Neodymium is used in the magnets for iPhone speakers. Europium produces the red colors in the screen, and cerium is used for polishing during the manufacturing process. Almonty CEO Black expects cooler minds to prevail at this time when the fragility of supply chains has become so acute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny almost overtly aggressive act to disrupt the supply chain further leaves countries with very few responses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Black says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u2019re being boxed into a taking a much more aggressive approach. It doesn\u2019t make any sense for anybody to go down this route, least of all the manufacturing engine of the planet, which is China. Killing your customer doesn\u2019t make good business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The outlook Miners will not quickly ramp up production. Producers of consumer goods like cars and smartphones will need to carry more inventory to reduce risk exposure. More blows to the supply chain, including factory shutdowns, are likely, according to Black. A rare earth mine. (Source: MP Materials) \u00e2\u0080\u009cVolkswagen shut down a production line a few weeks ago, and they cited the shortage of semiconductors. The cost of that to the company is dramatic. You have to ask yourself, what would it really have cost to have kept an additional 10 weeks of semiconductor supply? \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore disruption is inevitable, and this isn\u2019t going to be fixed. By this time next year, there has to be a proper approach, a diligent approach, not just by government, but also by industry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt took 30 years for China to get to this point, and they\u2019re very good at what they do. The example I use is when you finish work, go home at night and make a meal from scratch or just go to a restaurant. China is like a restaurant. You want something, it\u2019s available. Even though it\u2019s not always healthy for you, it tastes good, and it\u2019s easy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d China is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfantastic\u00e2\u0080\u009d mining operator, according to Black. But producers there may ignore contractual obligations in the interests of the state, he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u2019s just a consequence of that political system. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m for or against the political system. I\u2019m just saying that is part of your risk profile when you\u2019re operating under the fact that you have a dependency on that particular source.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Companies in the capitalist economy will need to stop giving priority to balance sheet management, according to Black. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA balance sheet now is the driver. It is no longer the the feeling or the strategy of the CEO or the market. You cannot carry inventory. Your CFO will walk into your office and blow his brains out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Balance sheets and inventories are not important in China, Black says. China has grabbed market share because of the flexibility of carrying inventory. While rare earths are quite common around the world, the mining and processing steps are expensive and harmful to the environment. For years, China has used its low-cost labor and lax environmental laws to dominate the global market and become the leading supplier, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. At the same time, miners outside of China face a number of issues, according to Black. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we look back over the last decade, we\u2019ve seen many factors now that have to be considered within a supply chain. Conflict minerals were really what started it all off. Are the raw materials being used to fund wars? You can\u2019t use those. Then we started getting into all the products being produced with proper social awareness. Children are not working in the mines or working in the supply chain. Are these mines or the supply chain environmentally responsible? What you\u2019re going to see over the next two to three years is a new is another level of risk. They\u2019re going to start assigning risk profiles to the supply chain. Do you have sufficient diversification?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Almonty, which mines tungsten, has no plan to enter production of rare earths. The same global supply issues will affect tungsten, according to Black. Tungsten is used in production of semiconductors, as well as aerospace, medical and defense goods. It goes into development of anodes and batteries that are used for wind farms and solar farms, as well as electric vehicles. China supplies more than 80 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tungsten after decimating the competition during the 1980s and 1990s, Black says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina arrived with a vast amount of material, and the price was basically collapsed. Since that day, all of my customers have always been supportive of diversification. Tungsten is a scarce, declining resource because there\u2019s very little of any of any size or any duration left on the planet. There\u2019s certainly a lot more rare earths available than tungsten around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Excerpts of this report come from Patterson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Next Target: Taiwan, which he published this year.]     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
