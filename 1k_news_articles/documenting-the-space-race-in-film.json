Documentary films are grounded in the real world, and because of this they can lend perspective, explore issues in-depth and, ultimately, instruct and enlighten. Such is the case with a handful of documentary films about the Space Race in general and Project Apollo in particular. The key insight revealed in all these films is that in going to the moon, humankind gained a unique perspective and deeper appreciation of our home planet. To the Apollo astronauts, Earth appeared so small and fragile against the blackness of the universe. That realization alone made the $25 billion expenditure (in 1960s dollars) worth every penny.

Many of these documentaries made heavy use of vaults full of NASA archival footage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some of it only recently rediscovered and reformatted for IMAX. The documentary form continues to evolve and inform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and often entertain just as big-budget, space-themed films have for decades. Here are our Top 5 space documentaries. \u00a0  In the Shadow of the Moon: This tightly edited documentary (run time: 110 minutes) directed by David Sington contains some of the most vivid descriptions of what it was like flying to and walking on the moon. Sington coaxed nearly all the Apollo astronauts (except Neil Armstrong) to sit down for two days to talk about what they saw, heard and felt. For example, many of the astronauts\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially the rookies\u00e2\u0080\u0094simply could not believe how much the Saturn V booster shook and vibrated during launch. Some assumed it would explode and break apart. At least one, Alan Bean of Apollo 12, admitted he was fearful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that [Apollo command module] window blows out, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be dead in about three seconds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bean recalled thinking. Sington includes just enough footage from the moon walks to underscore what a remarkable achievement was Project Apollo. Charlie Duke, the voluble lunar module pilot on Apollo 16, provided this evocative reaction to treading on the lunar surface: The moon was the most spectacularly beautiful desert you could ever imagine. Unspoiled. Untouched. It had a vibrancy about it. And the contrast between the moon and the black sky was so vivid. It just made this impression of excitement and wonder.  Then there is this perspective from Duke: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father was born shortly after the Wright Brothers. He could barely believe that I went to the moon. But my son Tom was five, and he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it was any big deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Composer Philip Sheppard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s celestial score succeeds in turning the iconic super-slow-motion engineering footage of the Saturn V launches into an Amish barn-raising \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an homage to the many astronauts, flight controllers and engineers trained at Midwestern engineering schools.
