While the six-year-old startup is mum on its product specifications\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as power level and benchmarking results \u00e2\u0080\u0094 its test chip, taped out in mid-2018 and housed in a Linux-based box, has been engaged in 16 pilot programs worldwide for a year, claimed Blaize co-founder and CEO Dinakar Munagala. Blaize describes its GSP as capable of performing \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirect graph processing, on-chip task-graph management and execution, and task parallelism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In short, Blaize designed the GSP to fulfill AI processing needs that have been previously unmet by GPU, CPU or DSP. To many industry analysts covering AI processors, this is a pitch they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard before. Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know a bit about ThinCI, but never got the architecture pitch. I'm glad they changed the name though.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The dearth of technical details on the GSP architecture in its slide presentation is feeding frustration and skepticism in the tech analyst community. Munagala, however, promises an information release in the first quarter of 2020.  High-level block diagram of the GSP architecture       (Source: Blaize) "}
