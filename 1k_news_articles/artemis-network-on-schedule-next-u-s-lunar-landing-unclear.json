Some of the earliest pieces of a return to the moon by American astronauts dubbed the Artemis project are falling into place with a string of contract awards for Gateway, NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orbiting way station that would be used for crewed lunar landings and, eventually, deep space missions. Among them is a contract award to SpaceX to launch early Gateway components, including the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost. HALO is being built by Northrop Grumman Space Systems. Maxar Technologies is supplying PPE, a 60-kilowatt solar electric propulsion spacecraft that also will provide power, high-speed communications and attitude control. It will also provide the capability to move the Gateway to different lunar orbits, allowing a future lander to reach the moon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poles where frozen water may exist in deep, permanently shaded craters.

Other competitors are SpaceX and a team that includes Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. As part of the PPE effort, TTTech Aerospace and RUAG Space will supply the Gateway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ethernet-based network platform, or what developers call the outpost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central nervous system. TTEthernet consists of switches, network interface cards, software and network configuration tools that enable the prioritization and precise scheduling of deep space communications. The networking platform is based on international interoperability standards for deep space missions forged by NASA along with the Canadian, European and Japanese space agencies. The avionics spec covers data link protocols and physical layer options for spacecraft interfaces. TTTech (the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name is a derivation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTime Triggered Technology\u00e2\u0080\u009d) said its Gateway network platform is based on its deterministic Ethernet approach, a framework that uses time scheduling to manage network traffic. The Gateway system could use the fault-tolerant network, for example, to converge high-priority real-time communications with \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest-effort\u00e2\u0080\u009d traffic on a single Ethernet architecture. A deterministic network would reduce latency, thereby guaranteeing critical and scheduled communications would get to and from ground controllers. TTEthernet uses redundant and reliable network switches and interfaces designed for mission critical communications. The scheduling capability would allow mission controllers to prioritize voice and data communications while reducing transit times during deep space missions for critical spacecraft maneuvers, said Bob Richards, TTTech North America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president for space.

(Source: TTTech) Since the time-scheduled Ethernet network is based on international avionics standards, other space agencies \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan tie into it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Richards said in an interview. He added that engineers in TTTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Houston facility are working with Maxar to identify commercial TTEthernet platforms that can withstand the rigors of deep space missions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTTEthernet technology forms the backbone for inter-element data and network communications across the combined PPE-HALO spacecraft,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Vince Bilardo, Maxar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director for NASA programs. TTTech and Zurich-based RUAG Space, which provides space qualified hardware, said they expect to deliver the first PPE network components to Maxar by the middle of 2021. Maxar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PPE would then be integrated with Northrop Grumman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HALO component of the Gateway to be launched by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Just when those Gateway components will be launched is uncertain. While the NASA contract awards indicate some momentum for the ambitious Artemis project, which optimistically calls for a crewed landing by 2024, early Artemis flights do not require the Gateway. Hence, a source said, NASA views Gateway as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca long way in the future\u00e2\u0080\u0094too complicated and too expensive right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, the massive Space Launch System that would propel astronauts to the moon has yet to fly. The first test firing of the SLS core stage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main engines was cut short in January after just 67 seconds. NASA delayed a second \u00e2\u0080\u009chot fire\u00e2\u0080\u009d test last month, citing a valve issue. No data has been announced for rescheduling the test.
