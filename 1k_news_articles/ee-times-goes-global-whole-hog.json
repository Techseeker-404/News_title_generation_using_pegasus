By both necessity and second nature, we adapt to changes. We work with fewer colleagues, figure out new ways to tell stories and learn, on the fly, to be fluent in new media (i.e. print, Special Projects and podcasts). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that our newsroom at Aspencore Media recently lost a few of our top-notch reporters. Just as this sort of all-too-frequent development upsets our audience in the electronics industry, it is equally devastating to those of us who remain. After all, they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just our colleagues; they were dear friends with whom we grew up at EE Times and other publications now owned by Aspencore Media. Every day across years we shared sources and contact information, traded war stories, laughed and bellyached. In this light, we understand the concerns expressed in the many phone calls, emails and personal messages from you in the electronics industry\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 asking us point-blank: Is EE Times getting shut down? The point-blank answer is no . Far from it. According to my partner in crime, Bolaji Ojo, Aspencore\u2019s Global editor-in-chief and general manager of EMEA, \u201cThe reality is that the network of editors, correspondents and contributors serving our readers has actually increased over the course of the last year. Way before the recent downsizing, EE Times and Aspencore had been expanding the team, adding critical experts as full-time employees, regular freelance contributors and analysts.\u201d He explained, \u201cEach of the people who have joined as contributors to the Aspencore network in the last year brings a specific range of critical expertise needed to provide the full breadth of coverage the industry requires. We have added experts in the fields of AI, IoT, sensors, power, interconnects, passives and electromechanical (IP&E) components, distribution and supply chain. Name the industry segment and we have it covered. If we don\u2019t have certain experts currently, you can bet that we are hunting for them.\u201d That\u2019s because the landscape is changing for our readers, customers and other observers. As the market has evolved, so has the Aspencore network. Bolaji stressed, \u201cBeyond the industry experts added, we have also expanded our coverage deeper into all regions to reflect the diversity in terms of where design engineering, components development and market growth are taking place. The stories filed by Aspencore editors and other contributors reflect local relevance where appropriate but they are also flavored with global context. It\u2019s a global market, afterall. But we don\u2019t just send editors from North America to cover Europe and Asia. Aspencore has editors and reporters in these regions and they collaborate with colleagues all over the world.\u201d Who we are Over the last twenty years, the owners and management of our newsroom have changed (too) many times. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud to say that EE Times has a very resilient newsroom. Our editors have spines of solid brass. We remain the independent voice of the global electronics industry. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suggest that these are not hard times. But we also won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dissemble about our firm commitment to blazing a path forward. In a nutshell, our answer to the current newsroom upheaval is to go global, whole hog.  As noted, among all publications covering the global electronics industry, we are proud to say that we are the only game in town. We boast more than 30 editors for EE Times and other vertical publications owned by Aspencore Media. They are scattered all over the world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from Shenzhen and Beijing to Taipei, London, Paris, Bern, Milan and Portland, San Jose, Washington, Massachusetts, Arizona and even Madison, Wisconsin. Some are full-time and others are part-time contributing editors. We also have a stable of young, passionate and eager-to-learn reporters. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sometimes amazed at the range of our newsroom\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 both in its depth and breadth. Our newsroom has evolved in its capacity to cover and analyze what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the electronics industry\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 throughout the world. Furthermore, we\u2019ve broken out of our regional silos. Our global newsroom is constantly exchanging story ideas. We are translating, more often than before, relevant stories posted by our Asian colleagues\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 from Chinese to English. Sometimes, our U.S. or London team picks up where our Asian colleagues left off as they advance important stories. As Richard Wallace, former editorial director of EE Times , used to tell us, the EE Times newsroom has always understood that it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just Silicon Valley: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe world is our oyster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brian Fuller, former editor-in-chief of EE Times , wrote to me a few weeks ago: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy two cents: EE Times is the last independent voice in the industry, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owned by Aspencore. It is not pay-to-play which makes it that last of a breed. Everyone else (no matter how much they say they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t) are pay to play \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Companies hated negative press in EE Times , but they LOVED and lived on good coverage when it was merited. It was unmatched validation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As another industry executive wrote to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need reporting on what is happening in our industry, now more than ever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our promise to you is that we remain that independent voice of the global electronics industry. Our newsroom stands on the shoulders of great publishers and editors in the past, including Girish Mhatre, Steve Weitzner and Richard Wallace. Under them, we learned to be a tag-team of tenacious newshounds with (to cite Lou Grant) spunk. In the following pages, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be introducing our newsroom today \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all of us. Just as the electronics industry has truly gone global, so have we. We intend to continue working closely with you in the electronics industry. Give us a call, ping us, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to get directly in touch with our global team \u00e2\u0080\u0094 any time of day. After all, with editors in almost every time zone on earth, the sun never sets on EE Times .        \u00c2\u00a0Editor (click for bio) \u00c2\u00a0Contact   Brian Santo brian.santo@aspencore.com   Nitin Dahad Nitin.Dahad@aspencore.com   Gina Roos gina.roos@aspencore.com   Echo Zhao echo.zhao@aspencore.com   Judith Cheng judith.cheng@aspencore.com   Steve Gu steve.gu@aspencore.com   Maurizio Di Paolo Emilio maurizio.dipaolo@aspencore.com   Susan Hong susan.hong@aspencore.com   Sally Ward-Foxton sally.wardfoxton@aspencore.com   Kevin Krewell kevin@tiriasresearch.com   Jim McGregor jim@tiriasresearch.com   Anne-Fran\u00c3\u00a7oise Pel\u00c3\u00a9 afpele@aspencore.com   George Leopold George.Leopold@aspencore.com   Barb Jorgensen barb.jorgensen@aspencore.com   Fendy Wang fendy.wang@aspencore.com   Alan Patterson alan.patterson@aspencore.com   Amy Guan Amy.Guan@aspencore.com   Luffy Liu Luffy.Liu@aspencore.com   Jenny Liao Jenny.liao@aspencore.com   Anthea Chuang Anthea.Chuang@aspencore.com   Yvonne Geng Yvonne.Geng@aspencore.com   Challey Peng challey.peng@aspencore.com   Lefeng Shao Lefeng.Shao@aspencore.com   Momo Zhong momo.zhong@aspencore.com   Clover Lee clover.lee@aspencore.com   Illumi Huang illumi.huang@aspencore.com   Matthew Burgess matthew.burgess@aspencore.com   Franklin Zhao Franklin.Zhao@aspencore.com   Elaine Lin elaine.lin@aspencore.com   Gary Hilson gary@hilson.ca   Cabe Atwell cfsatwell@gmail.com   Junko Yoshida Junko.Yoshida@aspencore.com   Demi Xia Demi.Xia@aspencore.com   Jessica MacNeil Jessica.Macneil@aspencore.com   Yorbe Zhang yorbe.zhang@aspencore.com   Bolaji Ojo bolajiojo@yahoo.com      Meet Aspencore\u2019s global team     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
