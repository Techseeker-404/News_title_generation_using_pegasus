Avatar Integrated Systems features substantially all of the technology of ATopTech, including the popular Aprisa and Apogee place-and-route tools used by a number of chip companies. The company also features most of the former employees of ATopTech \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including ATopTech co-founder and chief architect Ping San Tzeng \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as former Cadence Design Systems executives Chi-Ping Hsu and Charlie Huang. ATopTech filed for bankruptcy last year and put its assets up for sale after losing a long-running legal battle with No. 1 EDA vendor Synopsys. ATopTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assets were quietly scooped up in bankruptcy court by Avatar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chairman, Jingyuan Han, a Hong Kong businessman and steel magnate who has been listed by Forbes magazine as the 136th richest person in China. The bankruptcy and sale stemmed from a 2013 copyright infringement suit by Synopsys. In 2016, a jury in federal court found that ATopTech infringed patents associated with the command set instructions of the Synopsys PrimeTime static timing analysis suite, awarding Synopsys $30 million in damages and forcing ATopTech to declare bankruptcy. Prior to the bankruptcy, ATopTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place-and-route technology had grown quite popular with multiple customers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Samsung, Xilinx, and others \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and was eating into Synopsys\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market share. At its peak, ATopTech had about $30 million in annual sales, according to Laurie Balch, research director at Pedestal Research. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat all fell apart when the lawsuit was finalized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Balch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUp to that point, business was good and the technology was quite popular with users and considered to be high-quality and useful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Charlie Huang  Hsu and Huang joined Avatar relatively recently. Both have had long careers in EDA and were most recently with Cadence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hsu as chief strategy officer and Huang as executive vice president and general manager. While some of ATopTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers went away following the bankruptcy, many continued to use the tools and are now customers of Avatar, said Huang. Despite the legal maneuvering, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology has continued to keep the pace with technology node migration, according to Huang, who added that Avatar currently has three 7-nm projects with customers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we had been stagnant [post-bankruptcy], there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way we could have done this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Huang.
