That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the semiconductor industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new rallying cry, sounded at a daylong symposium sponsored by Applied Materials at Semicon West. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time of the node train is coming to an end. There needs to be greater collaboration from materials to devices \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hardware, software and systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d in new avenues, said Steve Ghanayem, former head of Applied\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transistor and interconnect group now scouting for acquisitions and alliances to take the company in directions beyond Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law. [Sponsored: Learn more about Safeguarding boot code and other critical data in NOR Flash] Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law is not entirely dead, of course. The race to smaller chips continues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for a few. In a keynote, CEO Gary Dickerson said Applied will announce soon new transistor materials that will reduce leakage current by three orders of magnitude. The news is nearly as big for chip makers as was Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advance in high-k metal gates in 2007. But today such advances are increasingly relevant only for an increasingly small group of designs and companies. It can cost $100 million to tape out a 7nm chip, and the time from tape out to first silicon is stretching out to four months, said speakers here. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a check few people can write \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as startup I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to write a $100 million check,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kurt Busch, chief executive of Syntiant, a designer of an in-memory processor for AI. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting less enthusiastic about the latest nodes. They are good for Qualcomm, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply to everyone else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dileep Bhandarkar, a server processor architect who left the company recently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think this is what the end of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law looks like,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Berkeley professor emeritus David Patterson, noting transistor costs are flat at TSMC and Intel is struggling to produce 10nm chips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNinety-five percent of architects think the future is about special-purpose processors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patterson who had a hand in helping Google design its TPU. Yan Borodovsky, a veteran lithographer recently retired from Intel, blessed the passing of the torch from Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law to AI as a new guiding light. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think something beyond today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s von Neuman architectures will be helped by something more than Moore. For example, memristor crossbars may become a fundamental component for neuromorphic computing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the world beyond Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law may be about how many kinds of synapses you can put in a given area and how complex they are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, taking a stab at an AI law.
