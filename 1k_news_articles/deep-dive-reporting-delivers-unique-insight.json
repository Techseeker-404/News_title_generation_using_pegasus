Answering MIT President Rafael Reif\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call to action, The Engine aims to incubate startups working on \u00e2\u0080\u009chard scientific breakthroughs\u00e2\u0080\u009d that deliver transformative societal impact. As it turns out, much of that scale of innovation requires hardware design and manufacturing expertise, which most startups lack. And therein lies one of the most challenging aspects of commercializing \u00e2\u0080\u009ctough tech\u00e2\u0080\u009d today: A whole new class of innovators and entrepreneurs, armed with a profound scientific breakthrough, are constrained by their nescience of electrical engineering.  Yet this challenge is hardly new, nor is it limited to non-electrical engineers. According to AspenCore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mind of the Engineer, the largest, longest-running, and most trusted behavioral study of its kind, the number-one concern for engineers worldwide is that they struggle to keep up with technology change. When asked how they coped, they unanimously answered that they turned to industry media publications, such as EE Times, to read and self-train.  Which brings me to why, at AspenCore (owner of EE Times), we believe that good technical journalism is vital to technological progress, and rather than degrading journalism to fit an online strategy of ever more clicks and page views, our first and preeminent concern is to present the best technical data, tools, and reporting to you, in the most succinct language possible, whenever and wherever you look for insight.  In July and August, we are excited to present to you an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look on sister site EDN with NASA and its latest TDRS-M satellite launch. We interview the team at Biosphere 2 about their progress on life sustainment modules for manned moon and Mars explorations. On EE Times, we speak to the movers and shakers in Grenoble, Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image sensor valley, and examine the feasibility of retooling Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s microelectronics industry. Meanwhile, editors in our Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Taipei, Munich, and Silicon Valley bureaus join hands to present to you an AspenCore original series on Made in China 2025: how China is embracing next-generation smart manufacturing technologies and what it means for the rest of the world.  In addition to EE Times and EDN, you can find these articles on other AspenCore sites, such as Electronic Products, Embedded.com, Planet Analog, or EBN, among others. Or, if you prefer to read some of our coverage in their original Chinese Mandarin, you can find them on 21ic.com or follow links on English sites to the Chinese edition.  Whether your calling involves finding a better way of probing plasma membrane to cure a hereditary disease or inventing a new nanotechnology to run molecular analysis on a microchip so officials can protect cities from biohazards, at AspenCore, our mission is to deliver important, deeply reported, and deeply mined stories and data about the technology and techniques that you need to do your job. As ever, we look forward to your queries, story tips, and feedback. Thank you for your support.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me directly: victor@aspencore.com.\u00c2\u00a0 I look forward to hearing from you. W.
