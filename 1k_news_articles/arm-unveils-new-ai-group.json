Exactly what the group will deliver and when remains under covers. Analysts suggest ARM could be as much as three years behind products from rivals such as Cadence, Ceva and Synopsys. ARM counters it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still early days for emerging markets where software is rapidly evolving, and lots of AI tasks are already running on its exiting cores. ARM declined to share the number of people or budget for the group, run by ARM fellow Jem Davies, best known for a decade working on ARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s media blocks. Rene Haas, president of ARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intellectual property group, defined it simply as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca big team in hardware and software.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear we will do [machine learning] in CPUs, GPUs and special purpose cores, but we are not announcing anything yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Davies said in a brief one-on-one after a press event at the ARM Tech Con here.  Davies defines himself as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe special purpose computing guy\u00e2\u0080\u009d at ARM. Officially, he had been focused on computer vision until the new group was created a few weeks ago. Both Davies and Haas made the case AI is still in its early stage and may be overhyped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorkloads change. [Neural nets are] just another workload. In various descriptions they are becoming the new black,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Davies said, pointing to a varied history of specialized hardware. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJava byte codes came and went, MP3 decode at sub-milliwatt power had a lifetime. MPEG looked like it would be general purpose, but trade-offs drove it to being a specialized chip. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said Next page: Catching up with IP rivals and Intel \u00c2\u00a0     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInNext Page "}
