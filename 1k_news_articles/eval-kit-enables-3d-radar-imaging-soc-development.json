The kit, which includes a chip with 40-transceiver array (40 Tx/Rx) complete with field-of-view (FOV) embedded antennas and wide-band 60-GHz imaging radar, enables development of applications for smart homes, robotics, retail, medical, and other industries. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Walabot-60GHz evaluation kit, which facilitates development, integration, and scaling of 3D radar image sensing SoCs, is a three-dimensional RF-based sensor and imaging system that can be installed on a wall or ceiling and detects objects in a defined arena and displays a real-time image of their positions within that area. The system comprises a 60-GHz RF sensor unit, an evaluation kit (EVK) engine that hosts software-performing signal-processing functions, a web GUI providing the user interface client software that communicates with the EVK engine via a TCP/IP connection, and an optional customer developed API client to communicate with the EVK engine via a TCP/IP connection. The digital interface connects the host PC with the EVK board. The interface is implemented using a Cypress EZ-USB FX3TM MCU and a micro-USB connector, which integrates the USB 2.0 physical layers (PHYs) and contains a 32-bit ARM926EJ-S microprocessor for data processing and for custom USB SuperSpeed applications. The integrated processor contains a general programmable interface (GPIF), which provides easy connectivity to popular interfaces. The array of 40 antennas is embedded with the PCB of the eval kit, connecting the sensor unit with the environment. For each transmitting (TX) antenna, there are multiple receiving (RX) antennas for collecting and recording the received RF signals. Each RX antenna and its associated TX antenna serve as an antenna pair. With the kit, Vayyar Imaging hopes to enable users to develop new applications that can be incorporated into existing systems or used to create new products. Its wide field of view along with high-resolution imaging can be used in obstacle avoidance, perimeter protection, ultrasonic replacement, automatic door openers, people tracking, posture detection, short-range imaging, and even point cloud technologies.
