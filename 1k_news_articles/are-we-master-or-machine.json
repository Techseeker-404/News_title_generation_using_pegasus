That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their entire business!\u00e2\u0080\u009d My colleague Rick Merritt also penned an op-ed  pointing out: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTraders may pound Facebook, stock and regulators may draw up rules for online privacy, but the Pandora's box of big data is forever open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Touch\u00c3\u00a9. I reckon that the popular sentiment is that privacy train left the station a long time ago. We already feel powerless. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to give up than fight it, because after all, no one has the individual power to cram Pandora back into her box. Not everyone in the world, however, feels that way. If Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, is any indication, Europeans are serious about giving back to citizens and residents control over their own personal data. Europe will start enforcing the GDPR next month.\u00c2\u00a0 Digital sovereignty  Curiously, many regulators and consumer activists in Europe have framed their privacy discussions as a matter of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdigital sovereignty\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 a term rarely uttered in the United States. Last Thursday, Emmanuel Macron, president of France, laid out a new strategy for artificial intelligence in his country. The French government will spend 1.5 billion euro ($1.85 billion) over five years to support research in the field, encourage startups, and collect data that can be used and shared by engineers.\u00c2\u00a0 Macron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is obvious. France is figuring out that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to start catching up to the U.S. and China. He wants the best and the brightest in the AI field to come to Paris. #AIforhumanity (Source: Tweet by Emmanuel Macron on March 30, 2018)  To most American observers, Macron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic argument is easy to understand. Just like President Trump wants to see more manufacturing jobs here\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as inviting Foxconn to open up a factory in Wisconsin\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Macron wants AI brains in Paris. Copy that. Where things get tricky for most Americans to comprehend is the French argument on \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Talking to Wired magazine in an interview that occurred right after his speech, Macron argued that France needs to be part of the AI revolution because the French need to see their \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalues\u00e2\u0080\u009d reflected in the way data is collected, used and protected. He said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you look at artificial intelligence today, the two leaders are the U.S. and China. In the US, it is entirely driven by the private sector, large corporations, and some startups dealing with them. All the choices they will make are private choices that deal with collective values\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On the other side, Chinese players collect a lot of data driven by a government whose principles and values are not ours. And Europe has not exactly the same collective preferences as the U.S. or China.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is where Macron introduces \u00e2\u0080\u009cdigital sovereignty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said: If we want to defend our way to deal with privacy, our collective preference for individual freedom versus technological progress, integrity of human beings and human DNA, if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the condition of having a say in designing and defining the rules of AI. That is one of the main reasons why I want to be part of this revolution and even to be one of its leaders. I want to frame the discussion at a global scale.  Well said. In many ways, while U.S. consumers, corporations and even our own government persist in laissez-faire attitudes toward our privacy while hoping for the best, Macron is taking a stand on this very issue that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not purely altruistic. Besides protecting his people from unwelcome cyber-snooping, he sees an opportunity to leapfrog the U.S. in a critical technological competition. The President of France stressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI will raise a lot of issues in ethics, in politics, it will question our democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The question is what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do about it. Silicon Valley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value?   As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve covered the tech industry in Silicon Valley over the years, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often observed a tendency for seemingly disinterested observers (like me) to be mesmerized by each huge technological leap the engineering community has made. But what sort of social values has Silicon Valley engineered?\u00c2\u00a0 Other than believing in the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invisible hand and that less regulation is always better, the engineering community leans toward an eerie silence about the social implications of their own products and technologies. The only time most Valley types speak out on such issues is to disparage\u00c2\u00a0critics who suggest that technology might have social implications. Earlier this year, I had a chance to chat with a whole bunch of data scientists working at platform companies like Linkedin, Amazon and Ancestry.com in California. Because the conversation was held over a private dinner, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to quote any of the people present. But they generally confided that Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upcoming GDPR \u00e2\u0080\u009cis what we all talk about all the time these days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Really? You guys are all worried about GDPR? Hell yes, they said.  The GDPR applies not only to companies based in the EU, but any organization anywhere that collects or processes personal data inside the EU. According to the European Commission, \u201cpersonal data is any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life. It can be anything from a name, a home address, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IP address.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The GDPR is a big deal for U.S.-based platform companies because they not only have to comply, but also because the U.S. has no equivalent regulation. This lack of regulatory harmony leaves a lot of gray area. What if a Danish citizen traveling to the U.S. posts a picture of himself on Facebook, but later decides to take it down? According to the GDPR, he has a \u00e2\u0080\u009cright to be forgotten\u00e2\u0080\u009d (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cright to erasure\u00e2\u0080\u009d). No such right exists on Facebook in the United States. One data scientist told me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrankly, most big platform companies in the U.S. are waiting to be sued before taking any action\u00e2\u0080\u009d on such privacy issues.\u00c2\u00a0 When I asked if there is anything that data scientists can do proactively to protect individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 data privacy\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether the individuals are in the United States or in Europe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the answer was firm no. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnless there are regulations, there is not much we can do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 This is a classic case of technology advancing far ahead of legislation. Most corporations, let alone engineers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who tend to be distrustful of politics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are loath to lay a fingers on thorny issues like this.\u00c2\u00a0 Am I too idealistic to suggest that it might be high time for U.S. citizens to define and articulate our privacy preferences and our own values?\u00c2\u00a0 Just because we can do certain things with the awesome technologies we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean we should use them. As Isaac Asimov often asked, are we the master, or are we the machine? Macron said during the interview, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe key driver should not only be technological progress, but human progress\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I do believe that Europe is a place where we are able to assert collective preferences and articulate them with universal values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Let that sink in for a minute.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times    "}
