Rapidly gaining momentum are suppliers of parts and components \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Omron, Rohm, Alps, Murata, and others \u00e2\u0080\u0094 promoting sensors and connectivity in modules, dabbling with AI software and the haptic technology that they see as a realistic key to the future of VR.  At this juncture, IoT has become a given for any vendor doing business in the electronics industry. But most noticeable on the show floor for those of us who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live in Japan was a host of robotic and sensor products programmed to talk, think, and behave like Japanese people, mirroring Japanese sensibilities, preferences, and habits. Generally, Japanese bots are much chattier than others developed elsewhere. Intelligent speakers are designed in Japan to not just take orders from users but to \u00e2\u0080\u009canticipate\u00e2\u0080\u009d their wants. They like to strike up conversations. More and more embedded systems come with AI algorithms, designed with a strong focus on \u00e2\u0080\u009cinference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We see the emergence of a number of new sensor-rich objects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including a baseball \u00e2\u0080\u0094 designed as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctools\u00e2\u0080\u009d to train humans. A ping-pong-playing robot is programmed to figure out the performance level of a human opponent. It adjusts its own proficiency accordingly. A common thread is clear: the Japanese development community has set its goal on perfecting \u00e2\u0080\u009cco-bots.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The focus is on getting bots to \u00e2\u0080\u009cunderstand\u00e2\u0080\u009d humans, not to beat or replace us. The idea parallels Toyota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cguardian angel\u00e2\u0080\u009d model for autonomous cars. In walking the show floor, the robots we bumped into tended to be short in height, with a non-threatening look \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cute, if not cuddly. They talk in the voice and speech pattern of a 5- to 7-year-old boy. No Terminator is welcome at CEATEC. As Japanese colleagues at our sister publication EE Times Japan told us, the design principles behind Japanese bots are rooted in Japanese cultural icons like Astro Boy (an android) and Doraemon (a robotic cat). Both are popular manga characters, with whom many Japanese \u00e2\u0080\u0094 engineers and consumers alike \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have grown up. They are admired by humans as pals and role models. On one hand, we worry that Japanese design engineers might be putting too much emphasis on bots who understand \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman emotion\u00e2\u0080\u009d and mood sensors that try to read whether the people in the room are sad, cheerful, depressed, hopeful, etc. Does this R&D emphasis skew toward bots as toys rather than efficient automation tools? On the other hand, how do we coexist with these next-generation machines if our bots don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009cget\u00e2\u0080\u009d us? In the following pages, we share a few things that struck us as new, hot, and curious at this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEATEC.
