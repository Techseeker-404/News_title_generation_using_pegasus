Smartphones are maturing.  In contrast, the Internet of Things (IoT) will still be hot. Fueling IoT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued momentum is the emergence of fully standardized NB-IoT, a new narrowband radio technology.\u00c2\u00a0   However, the market has passed its initial euphoria \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when many tech companies and service providers foresaw a brave new world of everything connected to the Internet.  In reality, not everything needs an Internet connection, and not every piece of data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 generated by an IoT device \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs a Cloud visit for processing, noted Sami Nassar, vice president of Cybersecurity at NXP Semiconductors, in a recent phone interview with EE Times.  For certain devices such as connected cars, \u00e2\u0080\u009clatency is a killer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csecurity in connectivity is paramount,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. As the IoT market moves to its next phase, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbolting security on top of the Internet type of architecture\u00e2\u0080\u009d won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be just acceptable, he added.  Looming large for the MWC crowd this year are two unresolved issues: the security and privacy of connected devices, according to Nassar.  GDPR\u2019s Impact on IoT  Whether a connected vehicle, a smart meter or a wearable device, IoT devices are poised to be directly affected by the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), scheduled to take effect in just two years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 May 25, 2018.  Companies violating these EU privacy regulations could face penalties of up to 4% of their worldwide revenue (or up to 20 million euros).  In the United States, where many consumers willingly trade their private data for free goods and services, privacy protection might seem an antiquated concept.  Not so in Europe.  There are some basic facts about the GDPR every IoT designer should know.  If you think GDPR is just a European \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mistaken. This is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cregulation\u00e2\u0080\u009d that can take effect without requiring each national government in Europe to pass the enabling legislation.  If you believe GDPR applies to only European companies? Wrong again. The regulation also applies to organizations based outside the EU if they process the personal data of EU residents.\u00c2\u00a0   Lastly, if you suspect that GDPR will only affect big data processing companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re misled. You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t off the hook. Big data processors will be be initially affected first in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cphase one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nassar. Expect \u00e2\u0080\u009cphase two\u00e2\u0080\u009d [of GDPR enforcement] to come down on IoT devices, he added.  Of course, U.S. consumers are not entirely oblivious to their privacy rights. One reminder was the recent case brought against Vizio. Internet-connected Vizio TV sets were found to be automatically tracking what consumers were watching and transmitting the data to its servers. Consumers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know their TVs were spying on them. When they found out, many objected.
