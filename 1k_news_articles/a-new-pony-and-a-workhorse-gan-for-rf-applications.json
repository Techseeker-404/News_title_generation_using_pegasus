This was certainly true of a recent announcement from Qorvo \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the QPA2309 C-band power amplifier (PA) product. At 100W of saturated power output for the 5 GHz to 6 GHz range, it is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cindustry\u2019s highest-power GaN MMIC.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is built using Qorvo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own QGaN25HV wafer process, which is gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon carbide (SiC) technology. Military and government funding for advanced product development has been getting a fair amount of attention in the last year or so. Many of the technologies are poised to spill over to the consumer world. This new Qorvo high power amplifier MMIC is designed for \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommercial and military radar, and electronic warfare applications\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect the military to keep this to themselves. SPONSORED | Lower Process Nodes Drive Timing Signoff Software Evolution For GaN technology more generally, we see that happening already. GaN for power applications was really confined to a niche not that long ago. Even for many industrial applications like automotive or inverters for solar cells, it was more typical to see SiC used for the components. (GaN has a long optoelectronics history as it enabled production of blue laser diodes and LEDs.) But now we see the beginning of an explosion of GaN in the power brick market. Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to ship the last iPhone without a charging brick will help fuel this transition even more as people who were once locked into Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice made for them are suddenly shopping for the high power, small form factor chargers. Since it is no longer an Apple accessory, consumers may now be drawn to power supplies meant to charge multiple batteries simultaneously, something Apple has never shipped with its phones or tablets. There are many interesting facets to GaN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique advantages for power electronics that I will not mention here. Fortunately, a recent EE Times special project delved into GaN for power electronics with one in the series of articles taking a very detailed look at battery charger design. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go back to the RF applications. It would be a challenge to argue that current technology trends continue to demand increasing RF capability and the components to power them. We are just at the cusp of the rapid deployment of 5G systems. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one more system and another radio (or set of radios) in connected mobile devices as well as innumerable fixed as well as moving IoT devices. Band requirements for new radio systems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 5G today and those still being defined \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are creating the ideal environment for continued and potentially rapid transition to GaN RF devices. As a wide bandgap semiconductor, the benefits of GaN over traditional materials will be well known to many engineers and serious tech watchers both inside and outside of this particular field. But a little additional explanation won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt. Looking for a little technical context to provide, I found a self-explanatory power-frequency illustration from a Bill Schweber article asking us all to make better use of graphics. (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m lifting one of Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s graphics just as I plow past 500 words without any visual aids.) GaN is in a league of its own as power and frequency increase. (Image source: Fairview Microwave via Microwave Product Digest) The graph from Schweber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article gives a strong indication of why we sit on the cusp of a shift to GaN for RF devices. The new Qorvo product sits just to the right of the region of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfew competing technologies\u00e2\u0080\u009d since the power amplifier is for 5 GHz to 6 GHz operation. In terms of power, however, GaN has no rival. The 100W power specification jumps Qorvo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PA squarely into GaN territory. The extent of the breakout potential for GaN was detailed in a recent market update from Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement. The analyst, Ezgi Dogmus, highlighted the GaN RF market in a series of Microwave Journal articles, most recently in one titled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRF GaN: The Stranglehold of 5G?\u00e2\u0080\u009d A selection of notable forecasts include:  GaN RF device market will exceed $2B by 2025 Annual growth rates touching 20% Rapid increase in military use GaN performance advantages will push 5G infrastructure adoption.  Dr. Dogmus predicts 5G infrastructure will drive the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGaN ascendancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The predicted growth applications are military and 5G infrastructure.\u00c2\u00a0 Strictly speaking, the 5G build out is an industrial application rather than consumer, but this technology is still central to addressing consumer mobile bandwidth demands. The GaN RF device market is on the verge of a significant growth spurt primarily in the defense sector. (Image source: Yole D\u00c3\u00a9veloppement) The choice of GaN for the Qorvo MMIC should be obvious at this point. For a power of 100W at over 5GHz, any material system alternative was, at best, close to the edge of the performance envelope. By most measures, the process technology used in the QPA2309 MMIC was exotic. However, another important element of this new product is less exotic but still significant. The Qorvo QPA2309 is packaged in a 7 mm by 7 mm QFN configuration with internal matching requiring no external components. The QFN (quad, flat no-leads) package is quietly expanding its reach. It offers a good compromise of low cost and reduced board space requirements for a range of pin counts. And this workhorse package used for everything \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from power management to audio amplifiers to microcontrollers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is continuing to add to its resume with high power and high frequency applications. The new Qorvo power amplifier drew attention to an emerging technology and an expanding mature package design. From the exotic to the mundane, both deserve a closer look, and I expect both will in 2021.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
