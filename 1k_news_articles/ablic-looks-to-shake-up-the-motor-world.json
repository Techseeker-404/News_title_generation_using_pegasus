(formerly Seiko Instruments) will make their first appearance at ELECTRONICA \u00c2\u00a02018 at Hall C6 Booth 147, debuting their new company name and looking to reposition themselves with a look to Western markets. While the company can look back on a rich history in the industry under their former name, they are looking to re-establish themselves boasting familiar Japanese tropes such as high-quality product while being sensitive to the needs of a rapidly changing market.  New ZCL Hall IC allows a more precise sensing of a rotor rotation One of the technologies ABLIC is looking to highlight is their ZCL (Zero Crossing Latch) Hall IC, which features a world-first detection methodology. This means the IC features neither unipolar nor bipolar latch detection: Conventional bipolar Hall effect ICs cannot detect a signal passing the 0mT (zero millitesla), the S-pole and the N-pole switchpoint, and it takes some time for the signal to be output when it reaches the detection point. Tomohiro Oka, one of the main engineers in charge of developing the new Hall IC, describes how this new product came to life: \u00e2\u0080\u009cElectric motors are a major field of growth, accounting for about 50% of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electricity consumption. While discussing with our customers, we realized the strong need to improve efficiency in the development of brushless DC motors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The ZCL Hall I C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new detection technology, which leads to substantially reduced tolerance calculation load during design, as well as a reduced load of adjusting and securing during manufacture, and should prove an instrumental technology during the development of the latest brushless DC motors, especially in terms of efficiency. Mr Oka continues: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe potential in the field of electrical motors is seemingly endless, and we are hoping to continue to provide our customers with solutions to aid them in the developing and design process for the next generation of motors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Presenting solution-oriented technologies  Aside from the Hall IC, ABLIC is highlighting numerous other products, including their Ultrahigh Efficiency Switching Regulator as well as their Battery Protection IC through which ABLIC is attempting to strengthen their IoT solutions offerings. The former allows for high-efficiency and longer operation of wearables such as smartwatches, hearing aids or fitness devices, while the Battery Protection IC is designed to avoid overcharge, assist in power saving and protect usage in various temperature settings, with applications ranging from industrial devices to vacuum cleaners, power tools and drones.
