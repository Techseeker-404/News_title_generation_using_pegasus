The Taiwan Tech Arena, in particular, will be showcasing many new developments in the fields of cloud services, cyber security, healthy living, and much, much more.  Taiwan Pavilion (Screenshot of Taiwan Tech Arena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Virtual Pavilion at CES 2021). Technology of the future Every year, the world gets to see the latest developments in the tech industry at CES. As technology progresses, so do the needs of the world, and by looking at 2020 we can determine the technological needs for 2021 and beyond. The growing role of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) suggests to even the casual observer that related products and services will soon be vastly improved upon to meet these modern demands. However, industry trends suggest the strongest focus will be in security, as privacy concerns and laws continue to be introduced, coupled with a significant uptick in the number of attacks against IoT devices. The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world to its core and has affected billions on the planet both socially and economically. To better address future diseases and pandemics, medical technology will look towards automated solutions to prevent contact between those infected and those who may pass that infection along. Speaking of automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will continue to be integrated into everyday life. However, AI may undergo a transition phase whereby its execution is moved away from remote cloud systems and directly integrated into edge devices. This not only ties in with the growing need for privacy, but also allows devices to work offline while simultaneously providing AI services. The virtual world Normally, CES is a massive gathering of the brightest minds involved with consumer electronics, but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly stops any mass physical gatherings. Of course, COVID-19 may be a show stopper, but it does little against the ingenuity of engineers and developers alike which is why CES 2021 will be turning to the virtual world. The Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion at CES 2021 will be featured on a virtual reality (VR) platform that allows visitors to explore the various stands and products currently being developed. Each stand provides a company a unique space to show off video, content, and images. This modern VR system, if you will, is compatible with all major browsers. How the Taiwan Hall will be structured This year, the Taiwan Hall is being organized into four separate categories that address problems or demands across various industries, and a final category that groups the innovation award winners. Smart Living & Healthcare This category is concerned with technologies that help with everyday living and healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the antiquated nature of most homes, as well as how labour intensive medical facilities are. Cybersecurity and Cloud Solutions The past decade has seen a massive drive towards cloud computing, and it is believed that this trend will continue. As such, cloud services will continue to be expanded and improved upon, but this also means that the importance of security will increase in importance too. The many malware attacks on IoT devices as well as the use of ransomware is demonstrating the inadequacy of current security measures; thus, cybersecurity could become the most important consideration when developing technology in the future. Mobility Tech The introduction of affordable electric vehicles is now seeing fossil fuel-based cars being replaced, and the development of advanced software architectures is changing the nature of cars itself. In the next decade, the software-defined vehicle will demonstrate how vehicles can be defined in software instead of hardware, while wireless communication methods will allow vehicles to communicate with each other to improve vehicle awareness and safety. Tech for Good This category is concerned with technologies that help bring people together and remove barriers that often stand in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way. Examples of technology that will be showcased in this category include platforms for learning a new language as well as VR systems that allow people to interact in new innovative ways. Key companies to look out for With over 100 start-up companies at Taiwan Hall, there is a lot of talent and innovation to be demonstrated. Of course, there are always those companies that stand out for products and solutions that catch the eye and drive inspiration: AIPLUX AIPLUX is a company that provides a multilingual trade mark filing system. In a world that is evermore connected, selling a product globally has never been easier, but protecting the intellectual property of the design is a major challenge. AIPLUX allows such designs to be quickly protected in most countries around the world, and allows for easy use of multilingual systems that would otherwise require translators and specialists.  Beseye Beseye is a company that specializes in AI camera systems, and at CES 2021 they are demonstrating their latest development. The camera developed by Beseye integrates AI technologies that allows it to not only identify people, but also their gender and age. Such technology can help owners of shops to better understand their audience which, in turn, can help inform them as to how best to change their business strategy to improve performance.  Arcran Arcran is a company that develops vehicle-to-everything systems, and this year at CES 2021 they are set to show off iSecV: a vehicle-to-everything monitor. This device utilizes AI to monitor and detect anomalous activity in a system and provide early warning signs when such anomalies are detected. The iSecV can be utlized in a wide variety of end applications, including cars, 5G networks, and homes to help guard against failures and malicious attacks that may go unnoticed.  PlayNitride PlayNitride is a company that develops displays seemingly straight out of science fiction. For example, their displays are fully transparent, allowing for the creation of GUIs and HUDs while also remaining adjustable. The bright and brilliant colors of the display allow for a wide range of end applications, and the borderless design makes them ideal for vision restricted applications.  Visit the Taiwan Tech Arena Pavilion There is a lot to see and experience at this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion. From checking out the latest technological innovations to attending talks and keynotes from industry leaders, it can all be viewed from your computer or mobile device. (Learn more about the pavilion.) To help kick off the launch of the Taiwan Tech Arena Pavilion, TTA will have a formal introduction with a first wave of press conferences, scheduled for\u00c2\u00a0Jan.10 9:30 pm EST and Jan. 12th at 7:00 am EST, which will provide introductory information across from the industries as well as solutions to face the uncertain nearly future.
