Among them are car makers in general and electric car makers in particular, whose systems are choking on data as they attempt to check out new car designs and run crash test scenarios using high-end simulation software. As it targets the high end of the electric car market, the emerging Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer NIO is turning to an American storage vendor specializing in high-performance computing (HPC) storage to handle processing-intensive and complex workloads. Panasas (Sunnyvale, Calif.) said this week that NIO will use its high-end storage platform for electric car design, development, and testing as it prepares to launch its ES6 electric SUV later this year. The Panasas HPC storage platform is built around a proprietary parallel file system architecture that executes both the writing and reading of unstructured data. The turnkey appliance combines hardware and software, a capability embraced by manufacturers such as NIO as they look to quickly ramp up EV design and production. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHPC [storage] is now becoming a primary technology for AI and machine learning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Jim Donovan, chief marketing officer with Panasas. \u00c2\u00a0      That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s especially true for manufacturing startups like NIO that are looking to move up the value chain in the emerging electric vehicle market. Along with vehicle design, NIO will use the Panasas storage platform for applications such as crash impact simulation. Donavan said that NIO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move to upgrade its storage was a response to a common problem: performance bottlenecks when running processing- and data-storage\u00e2\u0080\u0093intensive CAE and simulation software. In one common manufacturing scenario, engineers usually look to their IT department for storage resources, but enterprise storage platforms often can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cut it. In the case of the Chinese electric car maker, Donovan said that NIO \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas not able to complete simulations that would run on and on for days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Panasas platform addresses performance shortfalls by executing multiple data paths in parallel while combining data storage on hard drives for large files and SSDs for smaller ones. That balance is suited to design, prototyping, and other complex simulation workloads, added Donovan.

The protocol configures a parallel I/O framework between a client machine and the storage OS for file read and write. Donovan stressed in an interview that the system appealed to NIO because it is configured as an appliance that the car maker was able to plug into its existing design infrastructure. Or, as Donovan put it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cset it and forget it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d NIO said that its upgraded data storage infrastructure would be used to \u00e2\u0080\u009caccelerate the complex workflows associated with the design optimization and prototyping phase of our advanced electric cars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d HPC \u00e2\u0080\u009cplays an essential role in our vehicle design process, [and] we need to manage and work with the large amount of data generated during our rigorous design simulation process,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Zhijie Fang, NIO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HPC manager. NIO and electric vehicle competitors like Tesla are investing heavily in the HPC infrastructure needed to prototype new designs and run other data-intensive simulation software. NIO emerged in 2016 when its Electric Performance 9, or EP9, broke a record for the fastest electric car lap on a German test track. It also broke an American record for the fastest lap time by a production electric car. Its first production electric car, the ES8, was introduced in China in June. As with other electric car makers, NIO is seeking to reach a broader market by offering more affordable EVs. It is scheduled to introduce its five-seat electric SUV later this year. Those production ramp-ups are creating new use cases for HPC vendors. Garth Gibson, Panasas co-founder and chief scientist, was among a team of University of California at Berkeley computer scientists who developed the parallel storage architecture known as RAID, or Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 George Leopold is the former executive editor of EE Times and the author of Calculated Risk: The Supersonic Life and Times of Gus Grissom (Purdue University Press, Updated, 2018).
