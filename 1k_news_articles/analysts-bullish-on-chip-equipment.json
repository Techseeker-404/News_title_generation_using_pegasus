Pierre Ferragu, managing partner at New Street Research, summed up the sentiment, saying that AI and other major shifts in the semiconductor industry are setting the stage for major wars on the technology front, with outcomes that are difficult to predict. \u201cBut there's one person that always wins in a war, and it's the arms dealer,\u201d Ferragu said. \u201cIn this industry, the capital equipment companies are the arms dealers.\u201d Paced largely by continuing strong demand and rising prices in memory chips, the semiconductor industry is poised to grow 15 percent or more this year and could crack the $500 billion mark for the first time in 2019, analysts predict. Some market watchers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including SEMI president and CEO Ajit Manocha \u00e2\u0080\u0094 forecast that global chip sales could top $1 billion per year in the next seven to 10 years. SEMI's annual Bulls and Bears panel, a staple of the conference for more than two decades, revealed yet more exuberance, with participants highlighting massive waves of demand being created by AI, IoT and other emerging technologies. They predicted that the consolidation that has gripped the industry for the past few years will continue and said that the violent cyclicality that has characterized the semiconductor business since its inception has largely moderated.

As evidence, Muse said that even as DRAM prices continue to rise, Samsung Electronics has pushed back capital spending for DRAM capacity expansion by one to two quarters. \u201cI've never seen that in my time on Wall Street where a supplier cut capex at the peak of the cycle,\u201d said Muse, who has covered the industry for 25 years. Srini Pajjuri, a senior semiconductor analyst at Macquarie Capital, cautioned that business cycles are kind of unavoidable. But he added that the severity of downturns in the semiconductor space has changed dramatically in recent years. \u201cIn the old days, we used to call negative growth for a year a cycle,\u201d Pajjuri said. \u201cNow, the most recent cycle was in the second half of 2014 when TI missed estimates in one quarter.\u201d Pajjuri did caution that his firm expects the pace of chip sales to slow down in the second half of this year, although he still expects the industry to be up significantly for the year. \u00c2\u00a0\u201cAt this point, the growth we are seeing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than 20% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is probably not sustainable,\u201d he said.

Even with heightened regulatory scrutiny scuttling some acquisitions in the semiconductor space in recent months, panelists said they expect hyper consolidation in the industry to continue. \u201cWe are probably in something like the third inning of this level of consolidation,\u201d said Mark Edelstone, a managing director at Morgan Stanley. He said the biggest reason for the ongoing consolidation is that growth rates for most types of devices are lower than they had been, while at the same time costs are going up exponentially \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly at 7nm and below. \u201cIt's just hard to find the markets if you don't have economies of scale,\u201d Edelstone said. Edelstone added that its difficult to get a handle on the current regulatory environment, saying many people were surprised when U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the potential sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom and saying the blocking on national security grounds of the proposed sale of Lattice Semiconductor to a Chinese equity firm funded in part by the Chinese government was also difficult to understand. Most troubling of all, he added, is the continued delay in obtaining the approval of China's Ministry of Commerce for the acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm, which appears to be motivated at least in part by political factors. But Edelstone said he fully expects the era of hyper consolidation to continue. \u201cAt least in board rooms that we participate in, we aren't hearing people say that deals shouldn't happen because of the regulatory risk,\u201d he said, adding company boards want to understand and analyze the risks involved. \u201cIt would be my perspective that most of the deals are still going to go through,\u201d Edelstone said. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.
