Teardowns of the handsets also show that the company employed a combination of new and old tricks to pack features into its new flagship smartphone. The iPhone X is the most expensive handset that Apple has produced to date. The company is said to have supply chain problems ramping the new model, but Apple has so far declined to comment. Reports have emerged that Apple has started designing Qualcomm baseband processors out of handsets for its next generation. If true, the effort could parallel Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gradual shift from using Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chip foundry to dual-sourcing chips from TSMC and Samsung and now moving completely to TSMC. Apple packed two substrate-like PCBs into the handset, according to a teardown by TechInsights of a model with an Intel baseband. The high-density substrates use conductors and microvias measuring 10 to 15 um in width to link the two boards. The technique helps keep the handset to a 7.7-mm thickness. A teardown by iFixit of a model with a Qualcomm baseband described the boards as two halves folded and soldered together and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first double-stacked board we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in an iPhone since the very first iPhone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The PCB sandwich had 135% of the logic board size of the iPhone 8 Plus, iFixit estimated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe density of connectors and components is unprecedented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOunce for ounce, even an Apple Watch has more bare board \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the downside of this clever design is that board-level repair will be extremely difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0094 near impossible in some cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  In all its previous teardowns of smartphones and other products, TechInsights has not seen what it called the substrate-level PCB approach Apple used in the iPhone X. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExperts were expecting [to see this board technique] next year in the Galaxy S9,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Daniel Yang, a senior analyst at TechInsights. E. Jan Vardaman, a packaging specialist with TechSearch International, said she was expecting to see some novel board techniques in the iPhone X. She said she would be surprised if the techniques contributed to delays ramping the handset. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoard designs are usually done early on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.
