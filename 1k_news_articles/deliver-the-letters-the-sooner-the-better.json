{"Author": "Rebecca Day\u00a0", "Date": "03.04.2021", "Keywords": "", "Article": " Over the holidays, I ranted about packages I sent for birthday and Christmas that arrived way past their allotted Priority Mail window. I understood that the USPS was overwhelmed. As I wrote then, a package I sent to my friend in St. Louis arrived three days after her birthday even though I had mailed it well more than a week ahead to make sure it got there on time. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know at the time that a Christmas present I mailed on Dec. 11 for Christmas delivery would arrive in Columbia, South Carolina, on Jan 6. Even then, I thought that was a USPS hangover from the holiday season. On the receiving end, I picked up several holiday cards well into January, one with a postmark of Dec. 14. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that I appreciate the gesture any less, but cards with holly and wreaths feel a bit stale after the calendar has flipped to another year. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy Now, as the calendar skips to March, the problems live on. Only now, the issues are affecting essential mail, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not so forgiving. While I was tracking orders daily in December, trying to get a bead on my peripatetic packages, I signed up for what seemed like a handy service from the USPS called Informed Delivery. I could get a glimpse into the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expected mail drop before it hit my mailbox. It seemed like a good idea, and it still does, but only if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accurate. Now every morning as I peruse the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headlines, missives from colleagues and sales notices from Macy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in my inbox, I also open an email from the USPS giving me a sneak peek into the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mail dump. It shows the front of the actual letter, making it all the more real that I have mail on the way. Most of the mail is of the junk variety, but occasionally there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important mail and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad for the heads-up. Oddly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually a disclaimer at the end of the email also informing me of mail pieces \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor which we do not currently have images that are included in Today\u2019s mail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Today, in fact, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to two surprises. But 1) how do they know that and 2) if they know that, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they have images of them? Informed Delivery is an odd approach to take for a government agency under scrutiny because it has the potential to expose its vulnerable underbelly. Yes, I get to preview all the junk \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pitches from credit card companies, the latest L.L. Bean sale and my college hawking me for a donation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there, I can skip the mail run on a given day. But Informed Delivery, it turns out, also exposes the mail I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get. The mail that was supposed to come to my mailbox but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrive. Last Thursday, my morning USPS mail told me that \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoming soon\u00e2\u0080\u009d were a pitch letter from WNYC Radio and two cards from friends in St. Louis. As of Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mail delivery, the two cards hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrived. Informed Delivery told me last week they were arriving \u00e2\u0080\u009csoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Where did they go? That just leads to speculation. Were the cards delivered to the wrong address? Or more darkly, did someone in the delivery chain think the cards could contain money and took them out of the system? Clearly, my mail had been sorted, but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t delivered. What am I supposed to think? I really, really want to believe in the integrity of the United States Postal Service. I posted the tale to Facebook. One of the friends whose card is on detour commented that her card was thanking me for a donation I made in her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name after he passed away in December. It took her maybe 15 seconds to convey that message on social media, and she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to pay 55 cents for a stamp. Since the stamp and letter route didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work for her, maybe next time she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just use Facebook. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just packages, cards and letters getting lost, and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where it gets serious. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax time. What if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get all my tax forms? Not all of them are available online. My partner is a gig worker. Though she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been trying to nudge her clients into the digital payments world, some are still relying on the U.S. mail system. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s March 1, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still waiting for a check that was cut in Boston on Jan. 11. We could have walked to Boston, picked up the check, and returned to New York in that time. Now a new one is being cut and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asking for a pricey FedEx delivery that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sure to get through. I looked at the Office of the Inspector General website to find out how to lodge a complaint. It directed me to my local post office. The last time I called there to make a complaint, I was hung up on before I could get a word out. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broken, fix it. I want to like and trust the Postal Service again, the same way I want to use the New York City subway again. In both cases, I marvel that you can pay a nominal fee and then you, or your letter, can travel miles through an impressive network of routes and arrive at a destination. Both systems took a lot of human ingenuity to put together, and sadly both have fallen on hard times. At least if I get on the subway, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to my destination, eventually. So c\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon, Mr. Postman\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Deliver the letters, the sooner the better.     Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedIn "}
