It shone a light on the necessary path toward developing and producing sustainable products. With the tag line \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemaking the way we make things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this book set a lofty goal. As a species we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become pretty damn good at making things. So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to remake, you ask? While the making of things has its issues, that is not the primary problem: how we design them is where the seeds of the problems lie. Cradle to Cradle (C2C) presents an extraordinarily interesting perspective on the product lifecycle, but at a conceptual level. While it has plenty of examples, this is not a \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to\u00e2\u0080\u009d book; interpretation in the context of your products and implementation is left up to the manufacturer. After the book was published, the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute was founded to address the \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to\u00e2\u0080\u009d challenge. They developed criteria to certify products against principles described in the book. While no electronics have been certified to date, a handful of lighting and power distribution products are certified (albeit at the lowest level, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBronze\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The title refers to the goal, which is to avoid having a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrave\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the product lifecycle; the linear economy, as noted in last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s column, results in disposal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in landfills \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of products after they are no longer useful. The landfill is the product\u2019s grave. Cradle to Cradle introduced key concepts that led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccircular economy\u00e2\u0080\u009d by defining two types of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnutrients:\u00e2\u0080\u009d biological and technical. Braungart defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiological Nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u009d as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca raw material used by living organisms or cells to carry on life processes such as growth, cell division, synthesis of carbohydrates and other complex functions. Biological nutrients are usually carbon-based compounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These fully biodegradable materials \u00e2\u0080\u009care intended for safe return to the environment as nutrients for living things\u00e2\u0080\u009d; this is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbiological nutrient cycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cProducts optimized for the technical cycle are termed technical nutrients (e.g. metals and some polymers) and are intended to circulate in closed-loop industrial cycles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Electronics, perhaps excepting some medical devices (and research, which we will discuss in the future), are firmly in the technical nutrient camp. Achieving the technical nutrient cycle requires a complete understanding of materials and stages in a product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifecycle.\u00c2\u00a0 HP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inkjet cartridge enclosure recycling we discussed last month is an implementation of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclosed-loop industrial cycle\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Complete understanding of materials Consider the basic categories of materials used in the products you design and build. Primary material categories \u00c2\u00a0(and examples) include  Metals: copper, aluminum, iron, tin Polymers (plastics): polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyvinylchloride (PVC) Semiconductors and semiconductor compounds: silicon, gallium arsenide, gallium nitride Glasses and ceramics  A host of additive substances and compounds that vary based on the specific application are used to enhance or give these materials properties that enable their usefulness:  Adding other elements like beryllium to copper or chromium to iron give them particularly useful properties. Copper is already an excellent conductor of heat and electricity; adding beryllium gives it the strength and \u00e2\u0080\u009cspringiness\u00e2\u0080\u009d that allows it to be used for connector contacts. Iron, while cheap and plentiful, readily rusts. Adding chromium to iron results in stainless steel. Silicon by itself, while a semiconductor, is not very useful; it must be \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoped\u00e2\u0080\u009d with other elements such as arsenic, phosphorus and/or boron that create n- or p-type diffusions or layers. As noted in a previous column, the list of elements used in semiconductors is extensive. Polymers must be colored, stabilized and often flame-retarded with chemical additives to be usable and reliable in electronics applications. A wide variety of glasses and ceramics are used in electronics. Glass is widely used in displays, semiconductors, resistors, etc. Ceramics are found in integrated circuit packaging, surface mount (and other) resistors and capacitors, etc. Many glasses and ceramics are made from oxides of various elements (e.g., silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide) with other oxides and compounds (e.g. lead oxides) added to impart particular parametric or functional properties.  Creation of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclosed-loop industrial cycle\u00e2\u0080\u009d, therefore, requires consideration of the properties of each substance used in each material over (at least) the use life of the product as well as whether and how it can be separated from the base material it is used in (and, ultimately, whether it should be), or \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the case of components, assemblies and modules \u00e2\u0080\u0094 simply reused again in its existing form without concern for degradation over time and subsequent failure. Now you see why no electronic products have been C2C certified, and the simplest electrical products are at the Bronze level! Review the certification criteria noted above; let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discuss in the comments.
