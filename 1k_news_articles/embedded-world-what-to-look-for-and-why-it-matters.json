One thing that stood out for me was how, in the name of security, one of the many overhead drones in the city was transmitting images from which a face could be picked out from a crowd and subsequently be identified almost in real time. This might be in real life, but technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities are also found in art as well, such as in movies like the Jason Bourne series, where we see people being very precisely tracked and identified and followed in real time.\u00c2\u00a0 And then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the ultimate movie depicting IoT gone wrong, Die Hard 4.0 (also known as Live Free or Die Hard), where the bad guys take control of everything, from traffic signals to the power grids and the financial markets. I always like to understand the impact of technology, and these scenarios clearly demonstrate that reality. They also clearly bring home the impact of what many EE Times readers are involved in, from the systems design to the processing and interpretation of captured information. The principle of this is not new \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, while many marketing people get excited about and push the latest IoT device or almost every other press release or article mentions IoT as something of the latest trend, the concept has been around for many years, in terms of sensing and collecting information, processing it, and then making sense of it and providing a feedback loop. But what is new is the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming an integral part of more everyday objects and life, and this is why I think next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Embedded World conference in Nuremberg, Germany has now become one of the key events in the electronic engineers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 calendar (but not the only one, I should say). The smart city wall screens of the control center of Yinchuan, China. The screen at the bottom right corner shows faces being identified in a crowd.  The flurry of press releases coming in from vendors participating at the annual conference highlights just some of the developments which no doubt will come into reality in the near future \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from the latest chips and reference designs for IoT, to edge computing platforms and embedded vision systems. And with all this system connectivity, security is also going to be a key topic this year. NXP Semiconductors, for example, will be focusing on intelligent edge compute, end-nodes, connected cars and industrial systems. Its IoT edge compute capability includes application areas such as machine vision, machine learning, voice recognition, predictive maintenance, smart retail, digital signage, smart home and other edge processing capabilities integrated with the ClearBlade Edge platform. A key aspect of NXP's story at Embedded World is how these edge devices and end nodes are all connected to form a real-time local edge computing system which can function independently of the cloud. It will also demo aspects such as plug and trust security for IoT, secure mutual device authentication in a network using a secure element, biometric authentication using next-generation Kinetis wireless MCUs and node-to-cloud connectivity with LPC54018 MCUs using Amazon FreeRTOS.
