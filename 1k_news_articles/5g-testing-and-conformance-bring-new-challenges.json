Meik Kottkamp : The principles of testing and, in particular, for conformance have not changed moving from 4G to 5G. They continue to be based on agreements reached in the relevant 3GPP working groups. For example, 3GPP RAN4 defines requirements for both base stations and end-user devices and specifies the testing for base stations. Additionally, 3GPP RAN5 covers the testing specifications for end-user devices. Gaps in the test specifications remain even though initial 3GPP Release 15 NR specifications were finalized in December 2017 (for non-standalone operation of 5G and LTE) and in June 2018 (for standalone operation 5G only). The work in RAN4 and RAN5 requires core specifications to have been finalized to define performance requirements and test procedures. This work usually takes six to nine months and is not completed. The industry is pushing to bring timelines forward, and all of the companies involved are working toward completing the required specifications. Nevertheless, it will require more time. EE Times: How can customers be assured of meeting standards/specs?  Kottkamp:  In the widest sense, complete customer assurance is not possible because complete specifications are not available in some areas. This is because 3GPP applies to two broad frequency ranges: FR1 from 450 MHz to 6 GHz and FR2 covering 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz. Test requirements for FR1 conformance in the lower-frequency segment are more established thanks to the standard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s similarity with LTE. Conducted testing is possible for user devices in FR1 and requirements are finalized. Uncertainty is small even without all details being completed. EE Times: Testing in the FR2 range is more challenging. What are the issues with higher frequencies?  Kottkamp:  FR2 includes centimeter and millimeter wavebands, so conformance can only be demonstrated using over-the-air (OTA) testing in far-field conditions. Indirect far-field methods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, compact antenna range systems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are possible, but this relies on proving their equivalence with far-field techniques. A further issue is the use of dynamic beamforming antennas in this frequency range to overcome high path loss and line-of-sight blockage. Representing these spatial characteristics in an emulated lab test scenario represents a new challenge compared with existing test methods. Until these challenges are overcome, higher uncertainties will remain. The whole industry needs to work in unison to resolve remaining issues with OTA testing and dynamic beamforming. EE Times: How does 5G/IoT compare with pre-4G in terms of design-for-test challenges?  Kottkamp:  First, product developers and chip designers need to be aware of a triangle of different use cases with 5G. The Internet of Things is only one part of it. As well as the massive connectivity use case, which applies to IoT scenarios, these new standards address enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for automotive and industrial designs. A high-gain antenna array was measured in Rohde & Schwarz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antenna chamber in Memmingen to provide far-field results.Source: Rohde & Schwarz  EE Times: What is the impact for mobile broadband applications?  Kottkamp:  For the eMBB case, the differences between 5G and earlier generations are relatively small so long as they use the FR1 range below 6 GHz. The basic OFDM technology used in LTE is maintained. However, 5G brings increased flexibility in terms of physical layer parametrization (e.g., different sub-carrier spacings), which must be managed with more configurable and easy-to-use test instrumentation. As eMBB designs move into the mmWave league, they need to meet the challenges of FR2 discussed earlier. This has a significant impact on the test environment. Not only is shielding to be applied, but also calibration of the test setup is important, including the right choice for measurement antennas. EE Times: For massive connectivity use cases, 3GPP has recently decided to not address IoT applications with 5G NR technology. Does this bring different factors into play?  Kottkamp:  Further enhancements will be developed based on the existing cellular solutions, specifically machine-type communication (MTC) and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). Challenges here are different because the focus is on coverage, low power consumption, optimized signalling for the massive number of devices to connect, and especially on security. This is a topic all of its own, with some of the issues covered in the webinar \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is next in cellular IoT and how can we test it?.\u00e2\u0080\u009d     EE Times: URLLC use cases promise substantial potential for widespread adoption of 5G NR technology. What are the critical issues here?  Kottkamp:  Many industry sectors will adopt 5G to improve data security, connectivity, and process automation. 5G new radio provides low-latency support with high sub-carrier spacing, requiring short symbols, self-contained sub-frames, and mini-slot operation. Reliability can be improved with redundancy, and 3GPP 5G NR brings new options for dual connectivity: either EUTRAN + 5G NR dual connectivity or 5G NR dual connectivity. Requirements in these use cases are demanding and potentially extreme. To ensure that vehicle steering systems, M2M communications, or industrial control systems function smoothly, their networks may have to handle incredible amounts of data and do so virtually in real time, so test requirements will be tighter, requiring more accurate verification processes. Additionally, the need for monitoring systems will increase. High availability and security requirements are likely to be monitored continuously to ensure performance during network operation. EE Times: You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined the many challenges in testing for 5G standards. How is Rohde & Schwarz addressing them differently from other T&M vendors?   Kottkamp:  Any new standard creates new test challenges depending on its adopted technology. GSM introduced the first fully interoperable air interface based on an FDMA technology. Digital communication came in and we introduced techniques such as signal post-processing methods, which are standard today but were revolutionary in those times. The commercial success of standards like UMTS with CDMA and LTE based on OFDM technology demonstrates that testing challenges are successfully managed. Based on globally accepted certification processes, Rohde & Schwarz is continuously improving test functionality in a timely manner as the standards evolve. EE Times: Does the success of GSM and LTE make you confident that 5G NR will become equally successful in the market?   Kottkamp:  For 5G NR, we identified test challenges and this led to an advanced antenna solution, which requires efficient over-the-air test solutions. Consequently, we provide conformance grade shielding solutions for user-device testing in the cm-/mmWave spectrum with the R&SATS1000 test chamber. Likewise, the Plane Wave Converter (R&SPWC200) test solution significantly reduces chamber size for massive MIMO antennas operating below 6 GHz. It does this by creating planar wave \u00e2\u0080\u0094 i.e. far-field conditions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in only 1.5-m distance to the measured object. It generates a 3D spherical quiet zone of 1 m in diameter, resulting in an extremely compact test system for both R&D and production. Therefore, challenges are addressed and 5G NR will be successful based on both eMBB use cases and potentially on many new use cases in the vertical industry sector. EE Times: Security is a key issue in IoT. What does Rohde & Schwarz bring to the party?  Kottkamp:  Acknowledging the vital importance of security, we have also developed test solutions to judge the security strength of a communication link on IP level based on our established terminal tester platform R&SCMW500. Furthermore, leveraging our knowledge concentrated in our cybersecurity business, we foresee more demand for testing security especially in IoT and industrial environments. Already today, part of our test instrumentation enables generation and analysis of 5G NR signals in compliance with recently finalized 3GPP Release 15 specifications. We will continue to increase test functionality. We also support many trial activities with compact field testing equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, in correlating deployed network testing with lab testing results, which allows us to develop new test methods. One example is the capability to reproduce demanding real-world effects in the lab using our field-to-lab solution based on CMWcards. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nitin Dahad is a European correspondent for EE Times.
