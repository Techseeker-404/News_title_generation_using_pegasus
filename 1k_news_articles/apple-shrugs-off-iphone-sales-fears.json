Apple shrugged off recent warnings of softness in smartphone market demand to report selling 51.75 million iPhone sales in the fiscal second quarter, which closed March 31. Sales of iPhone units came in slightly below analysts' expectations of about 53 million, but were up 3 percent on a units basis compared with the same period of 2017. More importantly, Apple's iPhone sales generated $38 billion in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 14 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.

Analysts have questioned the sustainability of the $1,000 price point in the smartphone market. Over the last few weeks, several analysts have cut their forecast for iPhone sales in the first two quarters of calendar 2018. Last month, Morgan Stanley and Canaccord Genuity both lowered forecasts for iPhone shipments in the quarter ending in June to less than 40 million units. \u201cI think that it's one of those things like when a team wins the Super Bowl,\u201d Cook said Tuesday. \u201cMaybe you want them to win by a few more points. But it's the Super Bowl winner and that's how we feel about it. I could not be more proud of the product.\u201d Overall, Apple reported sales of $61.1 billion for its fiscal second quarter, an increase of 16 percent compared with the year-ago quarter and a decrease of 31 percent compared with the previous quarter. The company reported a profit of $13.8 billion for the quarter, up 25 percent year-over-year. Apple said it expects sales for the current quarter to decline to between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, higher than most Wall Street estimates.    Apple sold 9.1 million iPads for about $4.1 billion during the fiscal second quarter, year-over-year increases of 2 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Mac unit sales declined to about 4 million, down 3 percent year-over-year, while Mac sales revenue was flat, Apple said. Apple reported $9.1 billion in services revenue for the quarter, up 8 percent sequentially and up 31 percent year-over-year. Apple said its board approved a new $100 billion share repurchase place and a 16 percent increase in the company's quarterly dividend. Apple has spent more than $200 billion on share buybacks since 2012, the company said. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.  "}
