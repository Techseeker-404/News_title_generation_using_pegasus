The directive approved by Thomas Modly, undersecretary of the Navy, acknowledges the growing significance of what has also become known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cspectrum warfare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d defined as the merger of conventional tools like electronic warfare with cyber operations.\u00c2\u00a0 It also doubles down on Pentagon attempts to squeeze more efficiency from the crowded airwaves as more electronic systems hit the battlefield. That reality has prompted the services and the Pentagon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top research agency to look for new ways to re-allocate spectrum for electronic warfare (EW) and cyber operations. Image courtesy: DARPA  \u00c2\u00a0 The Defense Department has over the past five years placed a premium on developing agile systems capable of sharing congested spectrum. The Navy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new warfighting doctrine released in October is the latest reflection of that priority. The directive instructs all Navy branches, including the Marine Corps, to adopt an \u00e2\u0080\u009centerprise approach\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electromagnetic spectrum operations. That includes the procurement of electronic systems, subsystems, devices, and other gear that use spectrum. Scarce spectrum is forcing the military services to develop common, electronic warfare systems based on modular designs that can be customized for air, land or sea operations. But the Air Force, Army, and Navy have often sparred over individual requirements that have stymied efforts to develop joint EW suites. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no such things as a silver bullet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Marine program manager noted during an earlier effort on this front.\u00c2\u00a0 DoD released its Electromagnetic Spectrum Strategy in February 2014 that stressed enhanced spectrum sharing as prime Pentagon airwaves were auctioned for emerging wireless applications. The strategy stressed agile military spectrum operations, starting with the acquisition process.\u00c2\u00a0 Indeed, procurement was a key focus of the Navy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new spectrum warfare directive.\u00c2\u00a0 On the technical side, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a Spectrum Collaboration Challenge designed to use machine intelligence to help overcome spectrum scarcity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the number of military and civilian wireless devices continues to grow exponentially, the need for full access to the increasingly crowded electromagnetic spectrum has never been greater,\u00e2\u0080\u009d DARPA noted in announcing the next phase of the competition in early November.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo overcome the issues of spectrum scarcity, the [spectrum challenge] aims to redefine conventional, rigid spectrum management paradigms in favor of more efficient and fluid machine-driven approaches,\u00e2\u0080\u009d program officials added. Given advances in machine intelligence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is plenty of spectrum, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misallocated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted William Chappell, director of DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Microsystems Technology Office.\u00c2\u00a0 In one scenario, Chappell said teams must demonstrate how 15 software-defined radios can share the same frequency bands and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfigure out how they are going to cooperate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The well-known modulation approach 16-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) was used to improve spectrum efficiency. Chappell highlighted the fact that two \u00e2\u0080\u009cna\u00c3\u00afve systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d learned to speak 16-QAM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey learned how to communicate using 16-QAM without being programmed, [doing so] in less than a minute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chappell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis means that systems that weren't coordinated have the ability to learn how to interact."}
