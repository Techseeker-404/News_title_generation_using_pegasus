It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convenient to use AI as shorthand for deep learning \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it gets good hits in headlines. But these days, general AI \u00e2\u0080\u0094 machines learning on their own like curious humans browsing in a bookstore \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is still more science fiction than science. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spreading like wildfire through the internet these days are deep neural networks, a special case of AI based on processes typically initiated by people. The ability of deep-learning techniques to recognize patterns in images, speech, and other areas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often faster than people can \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has opened a door to a whole new direction in computing. Where this goes long-term is anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guess. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear is that, over the last year or two, lots of people have boarded this train, wherever it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bound. For what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too hard to see a handful of the next few stops that this train will likely make. 1. Accelerators will get traction  As we reported in September, at least four of the new accelerators for training deep-learning neural networks are now sampling. Web giants have been hungry for these chips for some time. As Baidu researcher Greg Diamos told us in late 2016, the job of training machine-learning models \u00e2\u0080\u009cis limited by compute. If we had faster processors, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d run bigger models.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no big stretch of the imagination to expect in 2019 that some of the top data center operators will start buying these chips in volume. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not realistic to expect to see the crowded field of startups here winnowed out in the coming year, but we will see some early winners crowned with sockets and real revenues. 2. Valuations will get scrutinized  Some of the startups getting traction in deep-learning accelerators are also getting huge cash infusions. I predict that this autumn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending spree will cool in 2019 as investors start to sharpen their pencils over exactly how much ROI they will see and when they will see it. The deep-learning boom has already attracted tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, around an expanding school of about 50 startups. In the last few weeks, there was a new burst of holiday spending. Habana Labs closed a $75 million round in November, bringing its total raised to $120 million. Wave Computing topped it with an $86 million round and a total of $200 million to date. Its flush principals used some of the money to buy veteran MIPS and announce plans to make its cores open-source. But Graphcore, hot off of news that Dell designed a system with its chips, raised a whopping $200 million Series D and a total $312 million to date. There may be more bursts of irrational exuberance in deep learning, but there will certainly be many hard and soft landings as business managers start plugging real revenue numbers into their spreadsheets.
