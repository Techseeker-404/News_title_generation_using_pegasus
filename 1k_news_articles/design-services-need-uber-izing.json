Samir Patel thinks that he has found one in the ability to customize standard products for an increasingly applications-centric chip market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are 200\u00e2\u0080\u0093400 design service companies, and half of them are in Bangalore \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [this sector] will get Uber-ized to provide more efficiency,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the chief executive of Sankalp Semiconductor at an event here. Just as Uber defined the new market of ride-sharing, design companies need to create new business models to deliver services faster and more cheaply. As the standalone, people-intensive part of the semiconductor industry, design services are \u00e2\u0080\u009cripe to be Uber-ized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patel in a talk at the D&R IP-SoC Days. The change may come more slowly than the dramatic rise of Uber. It will be motivated by the growing demand of application-specific SoCs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe days of standard products are going away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore and more designs are for chips with customizations for a given app.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Separately, he noted that a lot of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outsourced design work involves moving hard cores to new nodes. Meanwhile, services companies are expanding geographically beyond India, the U.S., and Europe to locations as diverse as Brazil, Morocco, and Vietnam. Texas Instruments started the trend, opening a design center in Bangalore in 1986. Intel followed in the mid-1990s, creating a tipping point.   "}
