You can click the logo above to see a list of other Special Projects that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done thus far.  Right now, Apple is probably the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most overwritten, hyper-analyzed company. And yet people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reporters, analysts, and consumers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get enough of the Apple story. Why? Quite simply, this is a company with all of the right elements to make a good story even better: popular products, engineering foresight, a turnaround history, corporate secrecy that borders on paranoia, and a co-founder whose premature death has elevated him an almost mythical figure. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to like? When Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation reached $1 trillion earlier this month, EE Times decided to share our take on its technology, business, and supply chain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 told in several distinctly different voices. For this look back on Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corporate/business analysis, we turned to Peter Burrows, an author and business/technology journalist who literally had a front-row seat to observe what he now writes \u00e2\u0080\u009cis surely the most ridiculous comeback in business history.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You can read his story, \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trillion-Dollar Fairy Tale, Warts and All,\u00e2\u0080\u009d here. For the look ahead with Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future, Bolaji Ojo takes a few bites of the Apple and applies his financial analysis to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mid- to long-term strategy. Ojo is editorial director at AspenCore Media, of which EE Times is a part. From the engineering standpoint, Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to internally design its own processors proved to be the biggest move that the company made. It turned the whole semiconductor industry upside down. More significantly, though, by designing its own SoCs so closely aligned with iOS, Apple has written a playbook for the rest of the tech industry. The company has established that hardware/software co-design is central to improving the performance of complex systems, especially in the coming age of artificial intelligence. EE Times asked Paul Boldt to flesh out Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s semiconductor ambition, its accomplishments, and how Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to design its own SoCs mattered. Boldt is a technologist who spent good chunks of his professional life drafting and prosecuting patent applications at one of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest IP law firms and three years reverse-engineering integrated circuits. But we all know that Apple alone did not make its trillion-dollar climb single-handedly. Critical to Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success is its supply chain strategy. Barb Jorgenson, editor-in-chief of EPS News, EE Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sister publication in AspenCore Media group, lays out the complicated relationship between Apple and its suppliers. EE Times editors also weigh in by profiling some of the roller coaster rides that chip vendors have taken en route to huge contracts from Apple, some of which ended in a swan dive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an abrupt termination by Apple \u00e2\u0080\u0094 off the rails.

Apple\u2019s Trillion Dollar Fairy Tale, Warts and All On a cross-Atlantic flight in 2008, I happened to sit down next to Kirk Kirkpatrick, a tech executive who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d worked for Apple early in his career.
