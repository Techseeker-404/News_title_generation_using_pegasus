NXP, whose acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor propelled it to the top of the automotive IC vendor ranking in 2015, held roughly 14 percent of the market in 2016, up from 13.6 percent in 2015, Semicast (London) said. Germany\u2019s Infineon Technologies remained the second largest supplier of automotive chips and Japan\u2019s Renesas Electronics held its position at No. 3 on the list. STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments also maintained their positions of No. 4 and No. 5, respectively, according to Semicast. Semicast estimates that the automotive semiconductor market was worth $30 billion in 2016, up 6.4 percent from $28.2 billion in 2015. The firm projects the market value to continue rising to $43 billion in 2023. Only one company, Microchip Technology, appeared among the top 10 for the first time. Microchip entered the ranking based on its acquisition of Atmel and assumed Atmel\u2019s spot on the list.  \u00e2\u0080\u0094Dylan McGrath covers the semiconductor industry and business news for EE Times.
