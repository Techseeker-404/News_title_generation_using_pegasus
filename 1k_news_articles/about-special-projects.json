From designers to business managers, AspenCore\u2019s audiences will get task-specific insights and guidance for understanding technology and business issues, provided in a collection of cross-linked articles across the international AspenCore network in publications such as EE Times, EDN, Electronic Products, Embedded.com, EBN, EPS (Electronics Purchasing Strategies) News, and others. Each of our Special Projects features an anchor story in a key publication with links to articles in other publications that supplement and expand on the themes of the anchor story. In coming months, we plan to cover a variety of topics, ranging from \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutomotive Safety\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI in embedded systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeterogeneous Integration Roadmap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecurity of Industrial IoT,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cProfessional Pi\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho Will Nail the Industrial Market?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is our landing page for the past and present Special Projects:  "}
