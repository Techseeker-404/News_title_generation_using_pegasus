Huawei, was everywhere to be seen in the letter. For example, CFIUS worried that \u00e2\u0080\u009cChinese companies, including Huawei, have increased their engagement in 5G standardization working groups as part of their efforts to build out a 5G technology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It added that \u00e2\u0080\u009cgiven well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Qualcomm had come up with many pretty wild arguments against the deal, but it never landed on the one proffered by CFIUS\u2013a lack of R&D for 5G could give Huawei an edge to dominate the 5G world, threatening U.S. national security. CFIUS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument made two interesting assumptions. It assumed Qualcomm is the only U.S. company that can do 5G standard-setting better than Chinese competitors. It also assumed Broadcom will not invest R&D in the work even though it knows 5G is key to national security, profits and contracts with the Department of Defense. Broadcom thought it could undermine these assumptions by immediately pledging to invest in 5G, but it did not convince President Trump. Qualcomm aired its own arguments surrounding CFIUS reviews on January 23 and again on February 9, right around the time it secretly requested a CFIUS review. Qualcomm argued antitrust reviews would require the parties to make divestitures, but there would not be that many buyers available because CFIUS would exclude anyone from China. Even with assets divested elsewhere, Qualcomm argued, China may require licensing commitments that would raise CFIUS concerns. The argument was so long-winded and complicated, that Qualcomm simply gave it up after Broadcom described it as \u00e2\u0080\u009cscary rhetoric, without any substance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In response, Broadcom confidently announced that there would be no shortage of viable buyers, including U.S., European and Asian companies\u00e2\u0080\u0094not to mention private equity firms. In fact, Qualcomm was convinced China would block the proposed merger. It thought China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antitrust laws would protect Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinese customers such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo who had voiced opposition to the deal. Broadcom, on the other hand, accused Qualcomm of getting too cozy with China, detailing on March 8 business dealings between Qualcomm and various Chinese companies. Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improving relationship with Huawei was part of the backdrop of the deal. On February 21, Qualcomm and Huawei said they completed 5G NR testing in Shanghai of the 3GPP Release 15 global standard. A report on March 6 said Qualcomm was moving very quickly to settle a royalty dispute with Huawei. These moves suggest that Qualcomm, left on its own, might not be so keen on defeating the supposed China technology dominance led by Huawei. From a legal perspective, CFIUS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter was unprecedented.\u00c2\u00a0 It initiated a review before any merger agreement was signed.\u00c2\u00a0 More importantly, its analysis did not focus on any national security concerns posed by the deal itself, but rather their ramifications on the ability of a particular U.S. company to compete with China. Chinese companies are no strangers to CFIUS reviews. In the last few years, the agency scrapped Ant Financial\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed acquisition of Moneygram in finance, the Canyon Bridge Capital deal for Lattice in semiconductors, Go Scale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed purchase of Philip\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LED business and even Beijing Dabeinong Technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed purchase of Waldo Genetics, a pig breeder. CFIUS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Qualcomm decision raises many new questions. Will acquirers with a history of expense cutting receive less favorable treatment? Will the new standard for foreign investment be a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to compete with China or any other country? Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Treasury Secretary and the CFIUS chair, wanted to assure investors this is not the case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis [Qualcomm] decision is based on the facts and national security sensitivities related to this particular transaction only,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. His comment may not provide much comfort to those who have paid attention to CFIUS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent history and its seemingly unstoppable power.\u00c2\u00a0 \u2013Ning Zhang and Wei Zhang are partners\u00c2\u00a0at\u00c2\u00a0CKR Law.
