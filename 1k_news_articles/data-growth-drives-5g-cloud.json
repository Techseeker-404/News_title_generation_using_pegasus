Ericsson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research projects 29 billion connected devices by 2022, 18 billion of them industrial IoT devices in factories, transportation and the grid\u2013surpassing consumer phones and laptops. This range of applications means a huge diversification of performance requirements for communication, with some use cases demanding a 5x improvement in latency, 100x faster data speed or 1,000x higher data volume. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to develop next generation technology across the whole system, from the RF front end to the base stations to the cloud networks with 3D beam forming for coverage, multi-user MIMO for capacity and a key role for GaN and GaAs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Koratala. \u00e2\u0080\u009c5G will mean a shift in the core network architecture, from being based on nodes to a true intelligent platform for dynamically creating the network in the cloud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. Meanwhile data centers are ramping their investment in high speed connectivity at a 60 percent compound annual growth rate as they strive to grow their data traffic by 2x per year.   Industrial and other IoT devices are forecast to make up the majority of tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s connected systems, surpassing smartphones and PCs. Click to enlarge. Source: Ericsson  "}
