A couple of years ago, for example, I turned my attention to batteries. Around three billion of these little scamps are discarded in the United States each year, releasing all sorts of unpleasant substances \u2014 including mercury, lead, cadmium, and nickel \u2014 into the environment. Most people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where to take these little rascals, so they end up dumping them into the trash. This really niggled me, so I created my own \u201cBattery Recycling Station\u201d located next to the coffee machine in our office\u2019s kitchen.  Everyone in the building now drops their old batteries into this box. When it starts to fill up, I simply empty it into a carrier bag and drop the batteries off at my local Batteries Plus Bulbs store for recycling. More recently, my attention turned to unwanted pharmaceuticals. Generally speaking, I take all of my prescriptions from beginning to end, so this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically a problem. However, my doctor just told me to stop taking a certain medication (something to make me even more wonderful, but she says I\u2019m already wonderful enough), thereby leaving me with a 180-day supply that was now surplus to requirements. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why, but I sort of assumed that all pharmacies would offer some sort of pharmaceutical disposal service so as to stop people from simply flushing unwanted medications down the toilet. Sad to relate, my hopes were soon dashed.  My first port of call was a CVS store on the way home. When I asked the guy behind the counter, he said that they offered no such service. He also suggested that I try calling the local police department because he dimly recalled that they provided a drug drop-off day once or twice a year. Now, although that\u2019s jolly nice of them, it\u2019s not quite as convenient as one might hope. My next stop was the pharmacy at the Kroger store near my home, but they said much the same as the guy at CVS. I was getting a bit despondent by now, but I thought I\u2019d give it one more try, so I popped into a 24-hour Walgreens on the way into work this morning. I was a tad surprised to see how many people there were milling around the pharmacy at ~7:00am, but I was on a mission, so I took my place at the back of the queue (I\u2019m English \u2014 if there\u2019s one thing we know how to do, it\u2019s form an orderly queue). After about 10 minutes, I was next-but-one to the front of the queue. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it always the case that the person in front of you at the pharmacy never seems to have a clue? I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have thought it was possible to ask so many questions about\u2026 well, let\u2019s not talk about that here (the gentleman in question was a little hard of hearing so he tended to shout, but \u2014 as everyone in the store soon discovered \u2014 his ears were the least of his problems). Some excruciating (but extraordinarily educational) amount of time later, it was my turn to ask the oracle behind the counter for her sage advice. \u201cDo you by any chance offer a service for the disposal of unwanted pharmaceuticals?\u201d I asked. You can only imagine my surprise and delight when she responded \u201cWe certainly do.\u201d And you can only imagine my surprise and chagrin when she pointed to one side and continued \u201cYou just drop them in that container over there.\u201d I turned to look where she was indicating and there, just to the side of where I\u2019d been standing for the last 20 minutes, in plain sight, was a huge, garbage-can-sized coffer festooned with garishly bright signs saying \u201cDeposit your unwanted pharmaceuticals here.\u201d After experiencing one of those Homer Simpson \u201cD\u2019oh\u201d type moments, I thanked the lady behind the counter and \u2014 with as much dignity as I could muster \u2014 dropped my bottles of unwanted pills into the container, after which I ambled out of the store as quickly as I could. How about you? Have you ever needed to discard any unwanted medications? If so, how did you achieve this feat?
