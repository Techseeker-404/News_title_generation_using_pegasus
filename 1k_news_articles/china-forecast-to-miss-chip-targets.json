In the short term, 2018 will be a good year for the global chip industry, despite the ups and downs of the DRAM market and capital spending, he said. China will fill 15% of its semiconductor needs in 2020 and perhaps 20% in 2022, predicts McClean. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant growth, but far from the targets of 40% in 2020 and 70% in 2022 that the China government has set. The goals are \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust ludicrous \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 China taking over the rest of the world in IC production is not happening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said McClean at an annual talk here. The country has pledged as much as $120 billion to fund its chip industry, in part because it spends more on importing semiconductors than on oil. But McClean expects that only about 10% of those funds will be spent over the next three years on capital equipment. He pegged China IC production in 2022 at $33.6 billion, 7.2% of the worldwide total, up from 5% last year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven with some upside, China will still make less than 10% of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production by 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I could see China getting 10% of the DRAM market but not taking big chunks out of Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McClean believes that Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to spend $26 billion on capex last year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than twice its average \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was motivated largely by China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambitions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are firing the first shot against the China companies. They want to get so much capacity that it will shut them down immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Samsung's capex investment, announced last fall, is more than Intel and TSMC spent on capex combined. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was one of the most amazing things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said McClean, who started his career as an analyst 38 years ago. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m too skeptical. Some say China will do what it did in steel and other industries, but chips are not the same thing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 18-nm DRAM technology is not easy to master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   China is expected to take less than a 10% share of the global chip market through 2022.
