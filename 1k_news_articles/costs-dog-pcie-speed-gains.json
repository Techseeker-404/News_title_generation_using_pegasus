In the end, its likely to be a mix of board makers for premium materials, chip makers for retimers, connector and cable makers for new kinds of channels, and tooling shops for new mechanical designs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeed costs money, so as we go to higher signaling rates, we will see how much people are willing to pay for it and how,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Krause, an interconnect expert at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The good news is that the PCIe is on track to ratify its 5.0 version by next April, delivering up to 32 giga-transfers/second. That will be less than two years since it delivered version 4.0 at 16 GT/s. Cloud computing is the main driver accelerating a PCIe roadmap that used to double data rates every three, four, or even seven years. Data center networks need faster speeds for their transition to 400-GbE, and a growing chorus of deep-learning accelerators feels the need for speed, too. The big tradeoff of the higher speeds is that signals won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t travel as far on existing designs. In the days of PCIe 1.0, the spec sent signals as much as 20 inches over traces in mainstream FR4 boards, even passing through two connectors. The fast 4.0 signals will peter out before they travel a foot without going over any connectors. So system makers are sharpening their pencils on the costs of upgrading boards and connectors, adding chips to amplify signals, or redesigning their products to be more compact. Retimer chips for a full 16-lane full PCIe 4.0 could cost $15 to $25 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if you can find them. Upgrading an adapter card from Megtron-2 to Megtron-4 materials might only add a dollar or so. However, the cost of a similar upgrade for a motherboard is about $100, and if the upgrade is to even higher quality Megtron-6 it would cost about $300. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe data center will go to Megtron-4 for PCIe 4.0 and that will add maybe $10 cost \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and you may still need retimers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Krause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor version 5.0, people will weigh even higher-cost PCB materials and retimers or move to cables.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   The PCI SIG is about to double the data rate of its interconnect in just two years.

PCIe 4.0 signals are only travelling three to five inches, said the CEO of PLDA Inc., a designer of PCIe controller cores that came out with 4.0 products three years ago. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot use FR4. We needed to move to Megtron-6; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really clear to me. If you want to get more distance, you need to use retimers, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit expensive and tricky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we have been using for 4.0 and expect to use for 5.0 is twinax cables and firefly connectors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe cost is very low compared to retimers, you can get whatever you want in distance, and the latency is really good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, Krause noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of interest in using cables \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for every inch on a board, you can go 10 inches on cables for the same power and loss budget, but cables have costs in being routed and connected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
