Congratulations, it is already Level 5, Full Self-Driving. No cruise? No problem! Just take something heavy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or even a suitable length of lumber \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and force the throttle open at the desired position. In either case, your car is \u00e2\u0080\u009cself-driving\u00e2\u0080\u009d and you are free to watch a movie on your smartphone, read a book, or even jump into the back for a sleep. Reader warning: It may be a long sleep. For the purposes of clarity, know that I am being facetious \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no car is capable of anything close to unmonitored \u00e2\u0080\u009cself-driving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This includes all Teslas, irrespective of what you may have read in the media or heard from celebrity CEOs. You cannot safely operate a vehicle today with your eyes off the road or your mind off the driving task. Welcome to adult responsibility! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drive. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem: Current \u00e2\u0080\u009cself-driving\u00e2\u0080\u009d tech works right up to the point at which it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t and then fails catastrophically. Failure happens in response to extreme, unexpected, or unknown situations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also known as edge (or corner) cases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and after the human has disengaged from the task of monitoring the system. Automated driving tech offers the illusion of proficiency in the form of lateral control (autosteering or lane centering) and longitudinal control (automated acceleration and braking). This is Level 2 on the SAE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taxonomy of automation levels, roughly translated to \u00e2\u0080\u009chands-off\u00e2\u0080\u009d driving. In a Level 2 system, the human is required to keep their eyes permanently on the road and mind on the driving task but can briefly take their hands off the steering wheel; Level 3 is sometimes called \u00e2\u0080\u009ceyes-off\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Level 4 \u00e2\u0080\u009cmind-off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus, the SAE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automation levels are most easily understood in terms of which driving tasks the human can STOP doing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 e.g. steering, looking, concentrating. Much of the confusion around self-driving and autonomy lies in the conflation of task automation (slowly moving from human driver to machine driver) with responsibility (all human, all of the time). Responsibility will only move to the machine driver at Level 5 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sometimes called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdriver-off\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is decades away from mass-market deployment, assuming it is even possible at all. The most experimental \u00e2\u0080\u009cself-driving\u00e2\u0080\u009d tech available on a series-production vehicle today is Autopilot from Tesla. Autopilot is one example of a Level 2 system, Cadillac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Super Cruise another. Where they primarily differ is in the use of \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or not, in the case of Autopilot \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a camera-based driver monitoring system (DMS) to permanently monitor the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head pose and attention state. To date, there have been no known fatal accidents involving Super Cruise, proving the efficacy of the camera-based DMS designed by Seeing Machines in cooperation with GM. Meanwhile, Tesla is making headlines again, following two fatal crashes in just the last couple of weeks. It is easy to criticize Tesla \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Elon Musk personally \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the growing list of fatalities linked to Autopilot, but the blame lies with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It is a federal safety agency (part of the DoT) and describes its mission as \u00e2\u0080\u009cSave lives, prevent injuries, reduce vehicle-related crashes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus, the mounting Autopilot death toll isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much a failure of Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology as it is of NHTSA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s woeful regulatory oversight and confused impartiality. The U.S. is now far behind Europe in the adoption of automotive safety regulation. On Feb. 21, the European Parliament voted to enact legislation for all new vehicles (truck, coach, and bus, too) to be fitted with camera-based DMS from September 2023, along with autonomous emergency braking and lane-keep assistance from September 2021. After these dates, Tesla cannot gain type approval (homologation) to sell its vehicles in Europe unless they comply with the safety legislation in its entirety and irrespective of having Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving. Regulatory job done. Ninety percent of all light vehicles in use on our roads and highways have no automated or assisted-driving features at all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 otherwise known as Level 0. With about 40,000 lives lost each year on American highways, the easiest and fastest way to make human drivers into safer drivers is with the mandatory installation of well-known, proven, and ground-truthed ADAS and camera-based DMS.
