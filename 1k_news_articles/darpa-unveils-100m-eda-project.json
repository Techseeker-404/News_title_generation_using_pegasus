The programs, involving 15 companies and more than 200 researchers, were described for the first time in a talk at the Design Automation Conference here. The two programs are just part of the Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI) expected to receive $1.5 billion over the next five years to drive the U.S. electronics industry forward. ERI will disclose details of its other programs at an event in Silicon Valley in late July. Congress recently added $150 million per year to ERI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funding. The initiative, managed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), announced on Monday that the July event will also include workshops to brainstorm ideas for future research programs in five areas ranging from artificial intelligence to photonics. [Sponsored: Visit LAYLA, the online marketplace created specifically for the specialized semiconductor industry] ERI used the stage of DAC to whet the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appetite with what it is doing in areas related to EDA. The July event will be a coming-out party for projects in materials and chip architectures. With $100 million in finding, the IDEAS and POSH programs represent \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the biggest EDA research programs ever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andreas Olofsson, who manages the two programs. Together, they aim to combat the growing complexity and cost of designing chips, now approaching $500 million for a bleeding-edge SoC. Essentially, POSH aims to create an open-source library of silicon blocks, and IDEAS hopes to spawn a variety of open-source and commercial tools to automate testing of those blocks and knitting them into SoCs and printed circuit boards. If successful, the programs \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill change the economics of the industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d enabling companies to design in relatively low-volume chips that would be prohibitive today. It could also open a door for designers working under secure regimes in the government to make their own SoCs targeting nanosecond latencies that are not commercially viable, said Olofsson.   "}
