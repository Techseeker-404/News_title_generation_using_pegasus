In short, servitization is the transition from selling products to selling the output or value that products deliver. This shift is putting a strain on many manufacturers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 often sub-optimized after-sales service organizations. For decades, manufacturers have been focused on repair execution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 repairing a product after it has already broken down. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers, however, want products that work all the time. This is driving aerospace manufacturers to shift their focus from repair execution to dynamic repair prevention \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or maximizing product uptime. While most manufacturers are in the early stages of their journey to servitization, it is already the standard way of doing business in the aerospace industry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one that was first championed by Rolls Royce nearly six decades ago.\u00c2\u00a0 According to Dirk Geisinger, business aviation director at Rolls Royce, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommitment to leading the way in which engines are serviced\u00e2\u0080\u009d has been central to its success. Its Power-by-the-Hour service first introduced in 1962 revolutionized the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfixed-cost-per-flying-hour\u00e2\u0080\u009d concept.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs innovators, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand still,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Geisinger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever the future in business aviation might look like, be it supersonic flight, vertical takeoff and landing, electrically driven solutions or hybrid planes, we keep pioneering the power that matters, looking forward to the next 60 years as the leading force in business aviation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The A330-800 takes off powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines (Photo courtesy of Airbus).

To put some hard data behind this significant trend, Syncron collaborated with Worldwide Business Research (WBR) to determine how prepared manufacturers are to meet this shift to servitization and maximized product uptime. The research highlights the gap between customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 increasing demand for maximized product uptime and manufacturers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to deliver it, plus strategies for manufacturers to start meeting these new expectations today. Some key findings include:  \u00c2\u00a098% of end users want to see more manufacturers provide service agreements that offer maximized product uptime However, only 33% of manufacturers currently offer service based on maximized product uptime today 51% of manufacturers indicated they have the infrastructure in place to support service models based on maximized product uptime, but still have more work to do to support this model, while only 25% of manufacturers indicated they can fully support service based on maximized product uptime today 58% of manufacturers believe customers would be willing to pay more for service agreements that guarantee maximized product uptime, while 57% of end users indicated an uptime guarantee would be worth the extra cost.  So, how should manufacturers plan to meet these new, evolving needs?  Redefine the customer relationship   Customer relationships with a manufacturer no longer end after the point of sale. As new equipment will no longer always be the purchased good\u00e2\u0080\u0094instead it will be a service subscription\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to make sure that their customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 equipment is up and running at all times. The shift to servitization means customers expect equipment to always be up and running, so providers must redefine their service models to focus on maximized product uptime. This requires IoT data, machine learning capabilities and predictive analytics to effectively manage data from equipment in the field and provide logical, automated next steps for maintenance and repairs.\u00c2\u00a0  Automate & optimize the service supply chain   A service model focused on maximizing product uptime will only realize its full potential when paired with sophisticated service parts inventory and price management solutions. While IoT data can provide visibility into when and where problems may occur, a service parts inventory planning solution will ensure parts are delivered to the right place at the right time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ensuring a repair can be made before a breakdown occurs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 while a pricing solution will ensure the part is sold at the optimal and most competitive price. A flexible, scalable solution will not only provide control at the manufacturer level, but also drive profits at the dealer level as well.  Invest in data-driven technology\u00c2\u00a0   As the role of the manufacturer changes to be more service-oriented, the integration of data-driven technology becomes increasingly important to success. For everything from predictive analytics solutions that help dealers know when service is needed, to sensors to help reduce energy consumption, sophisticated technology is needed to maintain a high level of service.\u00c2\u00a0 In very competitive markets, where there can be many different slow or fast moving, erratic and seasonal SKUs, manufacturers need to leverage these technologies to help them deliver a value-add that is unmatched by their competitors. Customers are becoming more and more service-oriented and technology is necessary to help manufacturers scale in real time. Maximizing product uptime is a crucial enabler in a manufacturers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journey to servitization. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an exciting time to be in this industry as we see a growing group of industry-leading manufacturers completely reexamine their after-sales service operations to meet these rapidly changing expectations.\u00c2\u00a0 Gary Brooks is Chief Marketing Officer at\u00c2\u00a0Syncron .
