Speaking to EE Times at Leti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual innovation conference here, Leti CEO Emmanuel Sabonnadi\u00c3\u00a8re said there needs to be a highly integrated and holistic approach to moving AI from software and the cloud into an embedded chip at the edge.

He commented on the Qualcomm bid for NXP being a key pointer as a driver for more computing at the edge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you think Qualcomm is buying NXP? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for the sensing, and to put digital behind the sensing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Emmanuel Sabonnadiere  To address the computing architecture paradigm, Sabonnadi\u00c3\u00a8re said that he hopes for some breakthroughs in Let's collaboration with professor Subhasish Mitra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team at Stanford University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s department of electrical engineering and computer science. Mitra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, in development for quite some time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Science Foundation, Semiconductor Research Corp., STARnet SONIC, and member companies of the Stanford SystemX Alliance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 focuses on exploring a new processing-in-memory architecture for abundant data and dense interconnections applications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a deep conviction that this is a way forward to address \u00e2\u0080\u0098more-than-Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099 challenges and have asked professor Mitra to create a demonstrator,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sabonnadi\u00c3\u00a8re, talking about the need to validate in silicon. At the conference, Mitra said a computing nanosystem architecture using advanced 3D integration is necessary for the coming superstorm of abundant data, where computational demands exceed processing capability. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to process the data to create the decisions, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much \u00e2\u0080\u0098dark\u00e2\u0080\u0099 data which we just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t process,\u201d Mitra said. \u201cLook at Facebook for example \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it took\u00c2\u00a0256 Tesla P100 GPUs to train ImageNet in one hour, which would previously have taken days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
