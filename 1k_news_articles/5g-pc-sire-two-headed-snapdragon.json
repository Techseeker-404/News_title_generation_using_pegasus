The 7nm chips demonstrate remarkable engineering execution at a time of unprecedented business, market and technology challenges. The Snapdragon 855, along with its X50 modem, position the company to dominate the first wave of 5G devices. However, the initial wave could be a small one given gradual network buildouts, and its expansion into Windows devices has so far gained negligible traction. Long term, the company faces a slowing smartphone market where it has lost a top customer due to patent disputes with Apple. After mergers with Broadcom and NXP were blocked, its road into the Internet of Things and automotive markets remains cloudy. And it sacrificed its hopes to stake out a beachhead in the data center to cost cuts appeasing shareholders. On the technology front, it will have to eke out performance gains in next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chips with little help from new process nodes. The enhanced 7nm processes ramping up for 2019 and beyond promise manufacturing efficiencies with the introduction of extreme ultraviolet lithography that mainly will benefit its foundry vendors. The good news is its hard work on the 855 positions it well for the next wave of handsets where it is again on the rise. Qualcomm bounced back to a 40% share in smartphone applications processor in the first three quarters of this year. It regained most of the ground it lost in 2016-2017 to OEMs such as Huawei and Samsung using their own handset chips and rival Mediatek getting design wins at China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rising handset makers, according to International Data Corp. (IDC). \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the last few years Qualcomm has really expanded its product line from the lower 200 series through a wide range of mid-tier 400 and 600 series and added a 700 series,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Phil Solis of IDC. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helped win back business from China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, where the midrange business has been described as a dogfight with Mediatek. Cellular basebands have been Qualcomm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big guns. It claims 20 operators and 18 OEMs will use its latest 5G modem. The 855 integrates the prior X24 Category 20 LTE modem supporting 7x carrier aggregation. It also supports two flavors of Wi-Fi \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the 60 GHz 802.11ay and the pre-standard .11ax, both claimed to be capable of 10 Gbit/second data rates.

(Image: EE Times)   Qualcomm claims the CPU complex of its Snapdragon 855 sports a 45% performance gain over its prior 10nm 845, its largest leap ever. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stunning claim given the new chip got almost no frequency gains out of its 7nm process as one of its engineers predicted. The 855 uses versions of Cortex-A76 and -A55 cores customized with help from Arm. The eight-core cluster is divided into a 2.84 GHz prime core, three 2.42 GHz performance cores and four 1.80 GHz efficiency cores. Each core group can be separately clocked, but the prime and performance cores share a power plane. The net result is a block that beats rivals in sustained performance, the company said. The star of the 855 is a set of enhancements across the SoC to accelerate neural network inferencing jobs. They include:  50% more ALUs in the GPU block, boosting performance 20% 4x the vector extensions in its DSP A new tensor accelerator core controlled by the DSP A DSP block dedicated to functions for voice assistants New dot product instructions in the CPU cores  The extensions target a range of formats from 32- and 16-bit floating point operations to 8-bit integer work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than one core, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complete system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gary Brotman, a Qualcomm product manager. The tensor core is said to be a matrix math array. The voice support targets a growing range of systems embedding Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Alexa, Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cortana and other assistants, driving interest in far-field mics and noise cancelation techniques. Analysts said spreading AI tasks across multiple cores makes sense and seems to be a trend already set by Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GPUs. The net result is a 3x performance improvement in AI jobs over its 845 and a 2x improvement over its nearest \u00e2\u0080\u009c7nm Android\u00e2\u0080\u009d rival.   The 855 outperforms smartphone SoC rivals, the company claims.   Click to enlarge.

To that end, two Google engineers talked about reducing latency and power consumption by running text recognition and other smart camera algorithms on the chip using Android\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neural net API. A dozen other software AI partners include companies working on noise reduction for video chats, image editing and payment systems secured by 3D face recognition. The 855 includes a laundry list of other advances for smartphones including:  A computer vision pipeline in the image processor Support for 4K video at 60 frames/second Hardware acceleration for H.265/VP9 codecs Support for the Vulkan 1.1 API, HDR 10+, the High Efficiency Image Format and lower latency audio  The enhancements add features and lower power consumption for cameras as well as apps from game play to virtual reality. As a cherry on top, the company upgraded separate chips that least one OEM will use in 2019 for fingerprint recognition using 3D ultrasound maps. Independent benchmarks of the 855 were unavailable. Nevertheless, the chip already snagged design wins with some of the first 5G handsets from OnePlus, Samsung and Lenovo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Motorola subsidiary. "}
