TDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Board of Directors approved the transaction on Feb. 28, and the closing is expected in the following days. Chirp is hopeful that the deal with TDK will create an opportunity for the startup team to accelerate the growth of its ultrasound technology across several markets ranging from automotive and IoT to home and mobile devices. TDK is not revealing how much it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paying for Chirp, mainly because the deal is small beer for a company whose revenue last year exceeded $10 billion.

(Photo: EE Times)  In an exclusive interview with EE Times, Michelle Kiang, Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, we founded Chirp, not to sell, but to grow our own business. But last fall, when we were raising money for our series A \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which was oversubscribed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we also heard of TDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were open to the idea of becoming a part of a larger organization because the opportunity appears to give us the chance to live in the same ecosystem they are already in, and it could become a way for us to scale our business at a much faster pace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d TDK, founded in 1935, might be Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best-kept secret among global electronics companies. Its best-known products, at least among consumers, are like magnetic tapes and magnetic heads. However, the Japanese company, which started out commercializing ferrite, has been methodically expanding in recent years, especially in the field of sensors. Most notably, TDK pulled off the acquisition of InvenSense, a $1.3 billion deal completed last May. Now a part of the TDK group, InvenSense, headed by Behrooz Abdi, has a technology portfolio consisting of Motion, Sound, and FingerPrint. As part of TDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MEMS Sensors Business Group, Chirp will become a fourth business unit focused on Ultrasonic Tracking and RangeFinding. Under the agreement, not just Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology but its entire staff of 15 will move to TDK and must stay there for at least several years. Move over, IR sensors?  Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultrasonic sensors, which combine a MEMS ultrasonic transducer and a low-power mixed-signal SoC, offer a clear advantage in size compared to existing ultrasound sensors.

For example, she explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CH-101\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wide field-of-view allows it to measure range even when it is mounted on the top or bottom sides of the phone. Since this is the location of the microphone and speakers, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy for designers to add another acoustic sensor at these locations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other words, Chirp could add its sonar-on-chip to the intensifying ToF battle in smartphones. Divi Gupta, vice president and general manager for Ultrasonic Tracking and Range Finding, was the man who talked TDK into acquiring Chirp. Kiang will be reporting to Gupta. He said that TDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in materials, such as piezo and aluminum electrolytic, could help enhance the distance that Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultrasound chip can reach. Divi Gupta persuaded TDK to buy Chirp. (Photo: EE Times)  It is believed that Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultrasonic sensor technology is complementary to TDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultrasonic fingerprint sensor products and the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other conventional piezoelectric transducer products. Chirp can also leverage TDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s packaging technology for small and highly robust MEMS acoustic products. Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sensors are further likely to find synergy with TDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inertial sensors and sensor fusion software libraries. For example, in VR/AR applications, Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 6-DOF controller tracking solution uses a sensor fusion algorithm to link ultrasonic ToF data with inertial sensor outputs to provide 6-DOF position and orientation in handheld controllers, said the two companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCombining Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultrasonic sensing expertise with InvenSense\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in inertial sensing and sensor fusion algorithms, we aim to significantly enhance this AR/VR system solution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Currently, Chirp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s piezoelectric MEMS ultrasonic transducers offer long-range and low-power sensing in a micro-scale package. These products are being pitched for design into VR/AR, mobile, wearables, robotics, and drones. They can also be used in occupancy detection. David Almoslino, senior director, corporate marketing of MEMS Sensor Group within TDK, also added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cChirp will be able to take advantage of TDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built-in distribution and channels to sell its products wider and deeper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related stories:   Chirp Adds Sonar-on-Chip to ToF Battle Ultrasound: Can Chirp Usurp UI?  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times   "}
